<blockquote><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The monitor supports the concept of user levels.&nbsp; At any given time,
there is an active user level.&nbsp; At startup, the user level is at its
highest (3).&nbsp; If left untouched (via the <i><a href="commands/ulvl.html">ulvl</a></i>
command), the user level will remain at its max and all facilities within
the monitor will be accessible through the command line interface.&nbsp;
If, however, one of the auto-bootable files lowers the user level, then
all accesses made to the hardware through the monitor's user interface
will be limited to the facilities that are available to the new user level.&nbsp;
Commands and files can be configured to be accessible only at a particular
user level (or above).&nbsp; At system startup, all commands default to
require that the system be at user level 0 or higher to execute (in other
words, all commands can be executed).&nbsp; If commands are to be restricted
to different user levels, then the ulvl command should be used in the monrc
file to make all the necessary adjustments.&nbsp;&nbsp; For example, if
the "flash" command is to be accessible only by user level 3, then in the
monrc file (or some other autoboot-no-query script) the line "ulvl -c flash,3"
will raise the required user level of the flash command and the line "ulvl
0" will lower the current user level of the system to 0; hence, to run
the flash command, the user will need to know the user-level-3 password.&nbsp;
Note that a default system startup does not have any password file installed,
so access to the various user levels is approved with any password.&nbsp;
The ulvl -p command must be used to create the three required passwords.</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The usefulness of this feature depends on the needs of the application,
but it basically provides the system with a mechanism to "protect" some
portion of the system from unauthorized users.&nbsp; The user level can
be raised, but only by a user that knows the password to get to that particular
user level.&nbsp; The passwords are stored in a file in TFS that is automatically
saved at the highest user level.&nbsp; The file is also unreadable by user
levels lower than the max.</font></blockquote>

<a href="#top"><img SRC="images/top.gif" NOSAVE height=20 width=20></a><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>&nbsp;<a NAME="example"></a></font>An
Example</font></h2>

<blockquote><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Assume you have an embedded system project that is to be sold to a VAR
(value-added-reseller).&nbsp; You want to use the same code base, but provide
specific configuration parameters unique to each VAR you sell your box
to.&nbsp;&nbsp; The VAR also wants to configure certain features based
on the customer it is selling to, and finally, the end customer may have
some administration parameters that it is able to configure on site.&nbsp;&nbsp;
This situation calls for the ability to have certain parameters configurable
by the manufacturer, but not modifiable (or possibly even readable) by
the VAR or its end user. Similarly, certain parameters are configurable
by the VAR and should not be accessible by its customer.&nbsp; Finally,
certain parameters are configurable by the customer, but should not be
accessible by "guests" of the customers system.&nbsp; Each of these parameters
should only be modifiable by the entity that is able to configure them;
hence, the need for file access and command execution priority levels.</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
This hierarchy of command and file access allows you to have certain portions
of the system accessible only at user level 3 (those that you use to configure
prior to shipment to the VAR).&nbsp; Then the VAR has certain configuration
parameters set up at level 2, the customer has level 1 and, finally, a
guest can log in at level 0.&nbsp; This allows a product to be shipped
with a common code base that is configurable though files that are only
accessible by the user level that needs to be able to access them.</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Currently, all commands are "visible" at all levels, but, since each command
has a user level attached to it; each command will only be executable if
that user level (or higher) is currently active.&nbsp; Likewise, for files,
a file can have a user level attached to it and only be modifiable at that
user level (or higher).&nbsp; Also, there is a "<a href="tfs.html#attributes">ulvl_unreadable</a>"
flag that can be associated with each file.&nbsp; This flag tells TFS that
for all user levels below the file&AElig;s designated level, the file is
not even visible to the user; hence, files that contain passwords or other
information that may be sensitive, can be "hidden" to lower user levels.</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Since the idea of user levels requires some kind of password to put the
monitor at that level, there is also a backdoor mechanism set up so that
we can gain access to a system by knowing its MAC address.&nbsp; This essentially
eliminates the possibility of losing accessibility because of forgetting
a password.&nbsp; The backdoor password is an encrypted string based on
the MAC address and can be created from a tool (<a href="tools/doc/maccrypt.html">maccrypt</a>)
that uses the same code as the monitor but runs on SUN Solaris and/or PC
Win95/98/NT.</font></blockquote>
