another Flash File System... Why?</font></h2>

<blockquote><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
There are flash file systems (FFS) available as extensions to most of the
RTOSes out there.&nbsp; Each has its own set of capabilities and each one
has to be hooked into the RTOS in some non-trivial way.&nbsp; Plus, an
FFS typically costs an additional fee to use.&nbsp; Then, if you use a
different OS, or possibly none at all, you have to determine whether or
not the FFS you are using is compatible with the new environment; and,
even if it is, you have to re-do the "hook-up" of the FFS to the RTOS.</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The model for TFS (and the servers that use TFS) is to keep things simple,
but still provide the embedded system with a wide range of facilties.&nbsp;
TFS is a linear file system that gives a typical embedded system project
all of the "file-system-like" capabilities it will ever need (most of which
would not come with an off-the-shelf FFS)...&nbsp; A complete programming
API that looks very similar to the standard open/close/read/write/etc...
system calls that you would use on a Unix platform.&nbsp; Also a command
line interface that allows a user to list, display, add, delete, load and
edit files.&nbsp; Its loader supports executables as COFF, ELF, AOUT or
ascii scripts.&nbsp; File decompression, user levels, a file change-log
and automatic file system cleanup (defragmentation) are also supported
with TFS.&nbsp; Its implementation is independent of the OS used (doesn't
even need one) and it is easily hooked into the application.</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Also, typical&nbsp; application-level servers that interface to a file
system are already written and available.&nbsp; HTTP, FTP and TFTP servers
can easily be incorporated into any RTOS/TCP-IP package that conforms to
the standard sockets API.&nbsp; Note that these servers are not full-blown
servers (no, the HTTP server is not Apache compatible!); but they do support
the majority of the typical needs of an embedded system.</font></blockquote>

<a href="#top"><img SRC="images/top.gif" NOSAVE height=20 width=20></a><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>&nbsp;<a NAME="implementation"></a></font>Implementation
Details</font></h2>

<blockquote><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
There are two defined sections of the system flash memory: flash space
used by the monitor code itself and the flash space used by the file system.
TFS presents itself as an API to the application code, allowing it to create,
modify and read files.&nbsp; To the user interface, it is seen as a set
of commands that manage those files (list, remove, display etc..). The
flash that is used by TFS begins on a sector boundary and, depending on
the defragmentation method configured at monitor build time, one of the
largest of those sectors may or may not be dedicated to interruptible defragmentation.</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
TFS organizes the files within the flash in a one-way linked list.&nbsp;
The initial portion of the file is a file header, which contains information
about the file, pointer to the next file and 32-bit crcs of the header
and data portion of the file.&nbsp; Maintaining unique crc checks for header
and data allows TFS to more accurately detect corruption.&nbsp; File size
is limited only by the amount of flash allocated to TFS, there is no restriction
with regard to sector boundaries.</font>
<center>
<p><img SRC="images/tfs.gif" NOSAVE height=512 width=640></center>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
When the system is first built, TFS must be initialized.&nbsp; This means
that the flash space allocated to TFS must be erased.&nbsp; From that point
on, as a file is created it is appended to the end of the linked list of
files.&nbsp; If a file is deleted from the list, it is simply marked as
deleted.&nbsp; At some point, after several files have been deleted, it
will be necessary to clean up the TFS flash space by running a defragmentation
(<a href="commands/tfs.html">tfs clean</a>).&nbsp; There are currently
two different mechanisms for TFS defragmentation that can be used (established
at monitor compile time).&nbsp; The simpler of the two does not require
a spare sector to be dedicated to defragmentation, but it assumes that
when it is run it can use as much RAM space as there is FLASH space dedicated
to TFS.&nbsp; Also, this simpler method is not protected from a reset or
power hit during defragmentation.&nbsp; This means that if the defragmentation
is interrupted, it is likely that the file system will be corrupted.&nbsp;
The second mechanism requires that a sector be allocated to the defragmentation
process, but it does not need RAM.&nbsp; It also uses a small block of
flash at the end of the TFS flash space for maintaining non-volatile state
that can be retrieved in the event of an interrupted defragmentation (power
hit or reset).</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Note that the spare sector cannot reside within the space used by TFS.&nbsp;
It must be at the end because TFS assumes that any one file is stored in
one contiguous block of flash.&nbsp; This, by the way, is a very nice feature
for extremely real-time dependent systems... A data file can be stored
in flash, accessed by name to retrieve the starting point of the data,
and from that point on, simple (and efficient) memory accesses can be made
to read data from the file.</font></blockquote>

Attributes</font></h2>

<blockquote><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
TFS supports file attributes.&nbsp; The attribute simply describes the
file to TFS, so that when TFS does some automatic stuff, it knows how to
do it.&nbsp; An attribute in the file header is simply a bit setting.&nbsp;
At the command line, each attribute is assigned a letter which is used
to display or create (in a non-verbose mode) the files in TFS.&nbsp; Following

each...</font>

Files</font></h2>

<blockquote><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At some
point in the startup of the monitor, it looks to TFS for auto-bootable
files.&nbsp; There are actually three different types of autobootable files:
two types established by the attributes assigned to the file and one special
case (the monrc file).&nbsp; For the monrc file to automatically run, it
must exist and be marked as executable.&nbsp; It will be run prior to any
other autobootable file in TFS.&nbsp; Actually, it is run prior to the
monitor having completed its own initialization (this is done so that the
execution of monrc can be used to configure the monitor as it starts up).&nbsp;
The remaining autobootable files are run after the monitor has completed
initialization.&nbsp; They will be run in alphabetical order, so the order
in which they are placed in TFS doesn't matter.&nbsp; The order in which
they are listed via "tfs ls" is the order in which they will be executed...</font>

binary executables can be configured with autoboot flags enabled; but there
are&nbsp; limitations.&nbsp; Consider the list of autobootable files to
be a script that contains those executables, each of which will be run

<h2>
<a href="#top"><img SRC="images/top.gif" NOSAVE height=20 width=20></a><a NAME="ipmod"></a><font face="Arial,Helvetica">What
is an "in-place-modifiable" file?</font></h2>

<blockquote><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp; Typically, when a
file is modified, the original file is marked as deleted, and the new version
of the file is appended to the end of the list of files currently stored
in TFS.&nbsp; This can involve a relatively large amount of overhead if
the modification to be made is trivial.&nbsp; As an alternative,&nbsp;
a file can be created as an "in-place-modifiable" file which means that
the API provides a means by which a file can be modified without the typical
deletion/re-creation step mentioned above.&nbsp; This is done by creating
the file as in-place-modifiable and specifying the file to be of some size.&nbsp;
The space is then allocated in TFS for this file, but the flash is all
left in a writable state.&nbsp; This usually means that the bytes in the
flash are all 0xff (usually, bits in flash can be cleared on a byte-by-byte
basis, but to reset them, an entire sector must be erased).&nbsp; All subsequent
writes to this file, then, are done directly to the currently allocated
flash instead of to a new block of flash.&nbsp; Obviously this puts some
responsibility back on the programmer, but it can potentially save quite
a bit of overhead if necessary.&nbsp; When a file is created as in-place-modifiable,
then the TFS API function <a href="api/tfsipmod.html">tfsipmod()</a> should
be used instead of the standard open-modify-close model.</font></blockquote>

<h2>
<a href="#top"><img SRC="images/top.gif" NOSAVE height=20 width=20></a><a NAME="user_levels"></a><font face="Arial,Helvetica">User
Levels</font></h2>

<blockquote><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp; The monitor supports
the concept of user levels.&nbsp; At any given time, there is an active
user level.&nbsp; TFS supports the ability to store a file at a particular
user level, then limit access of that file based on the user level at the
time of the access.&nbsp; The access can be limited to
<a href="#attributes">read-only
or not-even-readable</a>.&nbsp; Refer to the discussion on <a href="userlevels.html">user
levels</a> for complete details, but in short, this means that certain
files (and executables) can be configured to be accessible only at certain
user levels.&nbsp; Since each user level is attainable only via password,
a system can be built at user level 3, then lowered to user level 2,1,
or 0 and provide a certain degree of protection from unauthorized access.</font></blockquote>

Decompression</font></h2>

<blockquote><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
A typical application file will be either COFF, ELF or AOUT.&nbsp; Each
of these file formats has multiple sections of text and data that must
be transferred out of the flash space the file resides in, and into some
RAM/DRAM space that the application was built to run in.&nbsp; Decompression
of these file types is done by decompressing each of the sections within
the file from flash, directly into the RAM/DRAM space the section is destined
for.&nbsp; This "section-at-a-time" decompression eliminates the need to
decompress the entire file into some block of memory, then load from that
block into the actual memory space the image was built for.</font>
<center>
<p><img SRC="images/compression.gif" NOSAVE height=512 width=640></center>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
This mechanism requires some post processing of the final application file
built on a host using the <a href="tools/doc/elf.html">elf</a>, <a href="tools/doc/coff.html">coff</a>
and <a href="tools/doc/aout.html">aout</a> support tools.&nbsp;&nbsp; Two
different decompression methods are supported: huffman and zlib, each method
has its own set of advantages/disadvantages.&nbsp; Using the huffman decompressor
requires just a small extension to the monitor footprint (3-5 K) and no
additional memory for malloc, but typical compression is only about 15-20%.&nbsp;
Using the <a href="http://www.info-zip.org/pub/infozip/zlib/">public domain
zlib</a> utilities requires a larger extension to the monitor footprint
(35-40K) and additional heap space (see <a href="appnotes/heapspace.html#zlib_extend">appnote</a>
on heap space expansion for file decompression) for the monitor's malloc,
but compression with zlib can result in a 70% reduction in space needed
for file storage.</font></blockquote>

<blockquote><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Since the basic model of the monitor is to run without the need of any
interrupts from the host processor, how is it that TFS can keep track of
time of day?&nbsp; Actually, it doesn't.&nbsp; It depends on the application
code to provide it with two functions that will support this: getLtime()
and getAtime() .&nbsp; The first one, (long)getLtime(void), must return
a long that is stored in the header of the TFS file when it is created.&nbsp;
The second one, (char *)getAtime((long *)tval, (char *)buf, (int)buflen)
can be used to simply return an ascii string representing the current time
(if tval is 0) or it can return an ascii string representing the value
stored in tval.&nbsp;&nbsp; The value in tval will typically be the value
that was previously returned from getLtime().&nbsp; With this interface,
TFS really doesn't have a clue about time-of-day, but it uses the capabilities
given to it by the application to make it look like it does.</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Note that this is a feature that is used by TFS to populate an entry in
the header of the file being written at the time.&nbsp; If the two above
functions are not supplied to TFS, then the header entry is left blank,
and the file simply has no recollection of its time of creation.</font></blockquote>

<blockquote><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
TFS supports the ability to keep track of all modifications made in the
file system.&nbsp; This is done by logging an action (add, delete or in-place-modify)
and a filename to a file in TFS.&nbsp; By default this is not enabled,
but can be enabled/disabled at any time using the tfs log command.&nbsp;
The command will only run at the MAX user level and the file is created
at the maximum user level.&nbsp; If the tfsctrl(TFS_TIMEFUNCS) command
has been called to establish time-of-day functions in TFS, then the log
will also reflect the time at which the change was made.&nbsp; Following
is an example of the content of the TFS change-log (.tfschlog) file...</font>

Space Overhead Required by TFS</font></h2>

<blockquote><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>&nbsp;</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Overlaying TFS onto a FLASH device is not free.&nbsp; There is a certain
amount of space that is required by TFS; some of that space is fixed; other
space is based on the number of files stored.&nbsp; The following diagram
illustrates this...</font>
<center>
<p><img SRC="images/tfs_overhead.gif" NOSAVE height=512 width=640></center>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><b>Note1:</b> a file that is marked as
deleted in TFS requires less overhead than a file that is "living".&nbsp;
This is because when a file is dead, there is no need to allocate a defragmentation
header to that file.&nbsp; This means that removal of a file (even though
it is not actually erasing the flash) still frees up some memory space
for new file storage.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><b>Note2:</b>&nbsp; the spare sector must
be larger than all other sectors allocated to a particular flash device
within TFS; also, the sector that is just before the spare sector must
be large enough to contain all of the defrag header tables.&nbsp; Files
can never be stored in the spare sector.&nbsp; Files can be stored in the
sector that will contain the defrag overhead, but TFS will not allow the
file storage in that sector to exceed the space that is needed for defragmentation
overhead; hence, that sector should be as large as possible (but not larger
than the spare).</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><b>Note3:</b> when a file is copied into
TFS flash space, TFS first looks to see if this file with the same name
already exists.&nbsp; If it does, and the data in the new file is identical
to that of the current file, then there is no action taken.&nbsp; If on
the other hand, the new file is different, then the old file is marked
"stale" while the new one is being transferred into flash.&nbsp; This "<b>install-the-new
then remove-the-old</b>" mechanism is a protection against the case of
the new file transfer process being interrupted.&nbsp; If during the transfer
of the new file something causes the target to restart, then TFS can recover
by clearing out the partially transferred "new" file and re-installing
the stale one.&nbsp; The user must be aware of this because it requires
additional flash overhead... There must be space for the old and the new
in one device.&nbsp; Note that the user can remove the old one, defragment
and then install the new one to avoid this overhead, but then the protection
described above is lost.</font></blockquote>

<blockquote><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
In some hardware designs there may be more than one device that could be
used for file storage.&nbsp; TFS supports this.&nbsp; A default system
will have a boot monitor in the base of the flash, then all remaining flash
in that device is used by TFS and that's it.&nbsp; A more complicated system
may contain battery backed ram, a boot flash device and a secondary storage
flash device, etc...&nbsp; TFS supports multiple devices that are not necessarily
in contiguous address space.&nbsp; Each device appears to the user as a
directory, so any file can be stored in any device (limited by the size
of the device, of course), but a file cannot span across multiple non-contiguous
devices.&nbsp; For each device, the same power-safe defragmentation method
is used; hence, if battery-backed RAM was on-board, it could be used to
eliminate the problem of flash-life expectancy (see below) if there is
a need to modify files at a high frequency.</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
To "steer" a file to a particular device, each device has a unique prefix
that, when made part of the file name, tells TFS that the file is destined
for that device.&nbsp; If the prefix is omitted from the filename, then
the default device is used for storage.&nbsp; Similarly, the file-system
maintenance commands (tfs check, tfs clean, tfs freemem, etc...) can also
be pointed to a particular device by specifying the device prefix.</font></blockquote>

Life-Expectancy</font></h2>

<blockquote><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
It is important to be aware of the fact that the underlying technology
(flash) has a limited number of erase cycles.&nbsp;&nbsp; Current flash
devices typically support 100,000 to 1,000,000 erases per sector.&nbsp;
Applications will use TFS in different ways, so it is impossible to draw
any conclusions here with regard to how long the flash will last in a system
using TFS.&nbsp; This section will; however, discuss the way TFS uses the
flash so that the user can determine flash life based on their application's
intended use of the file system.</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
First of all, be aware that <i>TFS makes no attempt to do "wear-leveling"</i>.&nbsp;
If the file system you need is to be used heavily enough to require wear-leveling,
then buy one!&nbsp; Wear leveling adds a great deal of complexity to the
underlying implementation and is beyond the scope of TFS.&nbsp; In every
embedded system project I've been on, the need for clean interface to flash
by name (instead of by address) has been there.&nbsp; On the other hand,
the frequency of file modification has never deemed it necessary to even
consider wear-leveling; expecially with the trend by most flash manufacturers
to support 1,000,000 erases per sector.</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
As mentioned above, the TFS API presents itself to the programmer in much
the same way a standard OS's file system would be seen.&nbsp; This may
mislead application developers into thinking that the file system can be
thought of as a disk that provides the user with the freedom to write/erase
at any frequency.&nbsp; This is not the case! TFS's defragmentation mechanism
does not use a floating SPARE sector .&nbsp; This means that the spare
sector is the portion of flash that is likely to wear out first simply
because it is used as a temporary storage for all other sectors when defragmentation
is done.&nbsp; In a current Packet Phone Adapter design, there are 13 sectors
of flash used for TFS file storage and 1 for the spare sector.&nbsp; Assuming
worst case defragmentation (all 13 sectors are affected), then a defragmentation
run once a day on a part having a life expectancy of 100,000 erase cycles
will be good for over 20 years (100,000/13/365=21) .&nbsp; This value of
20 years makes the assumption that a defragmentation will be done daily,
and that all sectors are affected by the defragmentation.&nbsp; The frequency
of defragmentation and the number of sectors affected are very dependent
on the application's use of the file system.&nbsp; For projects that TFS
was originally designed for, this realistically means that there is no
need to be concerned with flash life expectancy.&nbsp; For newer applications,
flash usage must be considered.</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Let's discuss the way the sectors are utilized and how different applications
may wear out flash faster than others may... A flash sector is only erased
during defragmentation.&nbsp; When a file is deleted, it is simply marked
as deleted (a bit in the header).&nbsp; A file is deleted by the command
<i>tfs
rm</i> or through the API functions tfsunlink() and tfsclose() when the
file was opened to for writing or appending.&nbsp; If a file that exists
is opened for writing, the actual modification steps are deletion of the
original file and re-write of the new file after the file that is currently
the last file in physical flash space.&nbsp; Eventually this process reaches
the end of the flash space used by TFS, so defragmentation must be run.&nbsp;
At defragmentation, all of the space wasted by the deleted files is cleaned
up and the current list of active files is placed end-to-end in the flash.&nbsp;
This means that each sector used by TFS must be copied to the SPARE sector,
then that sector is erased and only the active files in that sector are
copied back to the original sector from the spare sector.&nbsp; This is
repeated for each sector in TFS.&nbsp; The defragmentation attempts to
make this as <i>sector-erase-efficient</i> as possible.&nbsp; If a sector
is not affected by the defragmentation, then it is left untouched; hence,
the number of sectors actually affected by a defragmentation depends on
the amount of flash space currently being used by TFS and the position
of the deleted files within the flash space.</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
In a typical embedded system project, the files in TFS will be the application
itself, a monrc file for system configuration followed by other application
specific files.&nbsp; The application executable is likely to be the largest
file and also the least likely to change at a high frequency.&nbsp; This
means that the space taken up by the application executable is fairly static
hence, the number of sectors occupied by the application will not contribute
to the wear of the spare sector.&nbsp; This fact in and of itself increases
the estimated life expectancy calculated above.&nbsp;&nbsp; On the other
hand, if the application executable is quite large relative to the total
TFS space available, then, if there are any files that are to be modified
on a regular basis, defragmentation will be run more frequently.&nbsp;
The point is that the actual wearing rate of the flash is very application
specific and must be thought out seriously.</font></blockquote>
