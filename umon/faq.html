is the purpose of this MicroMonitor distribution?</font></font></b>
<blockquote><tt><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></tt><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The
reasons for this distribution are similar to those of other open source
projects... The more the merrier.&nbsp; The maturity and extensibility
of a software package is definitely related to how much it is used and
the types of environments it is used in.&nbsp; The goal is to broaden the
user base with the hope that those folks will generate bug reports (hey,
and maybe even fix some!), generate new features (hey, and maybe even write
the code for them!) and generate good constructive feedback.&nbsp; In the
end, it benefits all.</font></blockquote>
<a href="#top"><img SRC="images/top.gif" NOSAVE height=20 width=20></a><a NAME="question_newuser"></a><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>I
am a new user, what do I need to know?</font></font></b>
<blockquote><tt><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></tt><font face="Arial,Helvetica">There
are a few different places you may have gotten this package from.&nbsp;
If this is part of the CD-ROM on the book "Embedded Systems Firmware Demystified"
or if you downloaded the package from <a href="http://www.bell-labs.com/topic/swdist/">Lucent's
Research Software Distribution Web Site</a> you have a "real" copy.&nbsp;
There were a few other sites that this was available on early in its public
release, but these are the places to get the most recent distribution.&nbsp;
Read and be aware of the license.&nbsp; In summary, it is a very relaxed
license that says "use it at your own risk".&nbsp;&nbsp; Aside from that,
the only thing to do is spend some time reading through the text.&nbsp;
Become familiar with some of the monitor's capabilities and limitations
to decide if it fits your needs.&nbsp; If you have comments or questions,
contact the <a href="contact_author.html">author</a>, but be aware that
this is a free, unsupported package, so no guarantees of functionality
or support are made (refer to the license).</font></blockquote>
<a href="#top"><img SRC="images/top.gif" NOSAVE height=20 width=20></a><a NAME="question_notallthere"></a><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>There
are a few .html pages &amp; .c files referenced, but not available.&nbsp;
Why?</font></font></b>
<blockquote><tt><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></tt><font face="Arial,Helvetica">This
is a package of descriptive .html pages and c/assembly code that Lucent
has allowed me to make available to folks outside of the company.&nbsp;
In doing this, some of the files in the package were determined to be inappropriate
for inclusion in the package available outside of Lucent.&nbsp; Some of
the files are not included because they are available through other sources,
so contact the <a href="contact_author.html">author</a> for more information
on this.</font></blockquote>
<a href="#top"><img SRC="images/top.gif" NOSAVE height=20 width=20></a><a NAME="question_memoryused"></a><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>How
much memory space is taken up by the monitor on the target?</font></font></b>
<blockquote><tt><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></tt><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Exact
sizes are tough because it depends on what parts of the monitor you need/want
in your system.&nbsp; If you look in one of the <a href="src/targets/target_dirname/monitor/config.h.html">config.h</a>
files you will see a lot of INCLUDE_XXX macros.&nbsp; Each of those macros
(described in <a href="src/common/monitor/inc_check.h.html">inc_check.h</a>)
controls the inclusion of some facility or capability in the monitor package.&nbsp;
At the low end it can conveniently be cut down to about 64K and the high
end is about 256K right now.&nbsp; The low end is "conveniently" cut to
64K with these macros.&nbsp; If there is more trimming needed, then other
chunks could also be removed, but they have not been separated out with
INCLUDE_XXX macros because no one has needed the footprint to be that small.</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the RAM side, that
too depends on what you want.&nbsp; It can range from about 16K to 64K
of RAM typically.&nbsp; The two big users of memory here are ethernet and
zlib; so, again, it depends on what you need.&nbsp; In the case of zlib,
the memory needs are through malloc(), so the size of the heap would have
to be adjusted.</font></blockquote>
<a href="#top"><img SRC="images/top.gif" NOSAVE height=20 width=20></a><a NAME="question_flashdevicesneeded"></a><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>How
many flash devices are needed to run MicroMonitor with TFS?</font></font></b>
<blockquote><tt><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></tt><font face="Arial,Helvetica">You
only need one flash device to run the monitor and FFS.&nbsp; Additional
devices can be used, but they are not needed.&nbsp; There is a page titled
"<a href="appnotes/memorylayout.html">Memory Layout</a>" that talks about
this.</font></blockquote>
<a href="#top"><img SRC="images/top.gif" NOSAVE height=20 width=20></a><a NAME="question_tftpandcommands"></a><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>Can
the monitor process commands while interacting with remote TFTP client?</font></font></b>
<ul><tt><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></tt><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Yes,
but there are limitations.&nbsp; When idle, the monitor is sitting in a
function that waits for characters to come in from the console port.&nbsp;
It is also polling its ethernet interface for incoming packets.&nbsp; If
an incoming packet starts up some TFTP file transfer, then for each packet
the console will be polled, so commands will be processed.&nbsp; Note that
things are slowed down simply because there are essentially two processes
goin on, and there are some obvious limitations to this... If a tftp transfer
is in progress, then be reasonable...&nbsp; If you try to kick off some
other TFTP transaction you will cause confusion; if you try to write to
the same memory that TFTP is using you will cause confusion; etc...&nbsp;
As a rule, the monitor code is single threaded; however, some "multi-threaded-like"
capabilities will work simply because of the way the interfaces are polled.</font></ul>
<a href="#top"><img SRC="images/top.gif" NOSAVE height=20 width=20></a><a NAME="question_wherearethetools"></a><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>The
make files reference tools that I can't find.&nbsp; Where are they?</font></font></b>
<blockquote><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
First of all, there are a few different build environments depending on
what you plan to build and where you plan to use what you build.&nbsp;
Everything in the package that is cross-compiled uses gnu-cc with a BASH
shell environment on a Win32 PC.&nbsp; The make files contain things like
"rm", "cp" and "find" because they run within a bash shell and assume that
there is a set of unix-like commands that are installed on the host system.&nbsp;
You can hunt around on the web and find a lot of this stuff for free, or
you can go to <a href="http://www.microcross.com">microcross.com</a> and
purchase a set of pre-built GNU cross-compilers, plus the BASH environment
(for PC or UNIX) for a very reasonable price.&nbsp;&nbsp; Aside from the
GNU stuff there are other tools, like <a href="tools/doc/moncmd.html">moncmd</a>,
<a href="tools/doc/newmon.html">newmon</a>,
<a href="tools/doc/ttftp.html">ttftp</a>,
<a href="tools/doc/defdate.html">defdate</a>,
<a href="tools/doc/elf.html">elf</a>,
<a href="tools/doc/aout.html">aout</a>,
<a href="tools/doc/coff.html">coff</a>
etc... The Win32 .exe files for these tools are under tools/win95 directory.&nbsp;
To build these tools for other environments, extract the source from the
tar file called toolsrc.tar.&nbsp; Refer to the individual subdirectories.&nbsp;
I have ported them to Sun Solaris, UNIXWARE (x86), LINUX and W95/98/NT.&nbsp;
If you port to something else and make changes, please send them back for
all to benefit.</font></blockquote>
<a href="#top"><img SRC="images/top.gif" NOSAVE height=20 width=20></a><a NAME="question_compiler"></a><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>Where
can I get a cross compiler?</font></font></b>
<ul><tt><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></tt><font face="Arial,Helvetica">All
the source code in the world is no good if you can't compile it!&nbsp;
In almost all cases, I use the GNU stuff.&nbsp; Never did any formal comparison
of GNU vs other vendors, but you just can't beat the price.&nbsp; If you
want to attempt to build them yourself, check out <a href="http://embedded.ece.uci.edu/~gimenezg/crosscompile.html">http://embedded.ece.uci.edu/~gimenezg/crosscompile.html.</a>&nbsp;
There are some instructions there.&nbsp; On the other hand, if you want
a really nice set of pre-built GNU-based cross compilers, check out <a href="http://www.microcross.com">microcross.com</a>
for both PC and UNIX environments.&nbsp; Here's a picture of their packaging...</font>
<center><img SRC="images/MicroCrossXToolsBox.jpg" NOSAVE height=286 width=216></center>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I've converted all of my monitor make files
over to use this toolset.&nbsp; It includes cross-compilation tools for
all of the GNU-GCC cross compilers, plus, for PCs, the Bash shell and full
suite of unix-like tools are included.&nbsp; Check it out!</font></ul>
<a href="#top"><img SRC="images/top.gif" NOSAVE height=20 width=20></a><a NAME="question_futureports"></a><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>What
are the plans for future ports of MicroMonitor?</font></font></b>
<ul><tt><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></tt><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Porting
the monitor to a new platform is relatively straightforward (see "<a href="appnotes/porting.html">Porting
to a New Target</a>").&nbsp; The ports made available through this package
depend on a few things:</font>
<br>&nbsp;
<ul>
<li>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">Requests from users.</font></li>

<li>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">Availability of an off-the-shelf platform.</font></li>

<li>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">Other folks that contribute ports back to
this package.</font></li>
</ul>

<p><br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Note that I will respond to requests.&nbsp;
The recent release of the FADS860 port was due to a large number of folks
interested; however, I am hoping that folks are willing to do this on their
own, and return the ported environment to me for distribution with the
package.</font>
<ul>&nbsp;</ul>

<a href="#top"><img SRC="images/top.gif" NOSAVE height=20 width=20></a><a NAME="question_charge"></a><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>How
much does the author charge for a new port of the MicroMonitor?</font></font></b>
<blockquote><tt><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></tt><font face="Arial,Helvetica">In
a perfect world, I would charge as much as I want, and you would be glad
to pay me!&nbsp; In the real world, I do externally requested ports in
my spare time for free, so when I commit to a new target port, realize
that it is still potentially months away.</font></blockquote>

outside and my son wants to have a catch!&nbsp; <i>Chuckle!</i>&nbsp; Of

<ol>
<li>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica"><b>Read this FAQ</b> and the included documentation

<font face="Arial,Helvetica"><b>Send me comments</b>.&nbsp; Constructive
feedback is very useful.&nbsp; Whether you are going to send "atta-boy"
or "whatta-idiot" comments is up to you.&nbsp; If you have suggestions

you don't like my coding style.&nbsp; Tell me why a different method is
better.</font></li>

<li>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica"><b>Bug reports </b>are the primary reason

<li>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica"><b>New ideas or enhancements </b>are the secondary
reason for this distribution.&nbsp; If you have ideas for improvement or
just new stuff, I want to hear that too.&nbsp; Can't promise that it will
be incorporated in, but that doesn't mean it wasn't a good idea.</font></li>

Fame is the result!&nbsp; Yes, you too, could have your name added to the
MicroMonitor "contributors" list.&nbsp; Boy, that's just gotta get you
excited!&nbsp; <i>Yea, I know, I need a vacation.&nbsp; </i>Seriously though,
the more folks that contribute and are willing to have their name added
to the contributors list, the more the load is distributed across other
folks besides me.&nbsp; Yes, I will ask for your email address as a contributor
so others can contact you to ask questions about something you have done.</font></blockquote>
<a href="#top"><img SRC="images/top.gif" NOSAVE height=20 width=20></a><a NAME="question_writer"></a><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>Who
wrote this?</font></font></b>
<blockquote><tt><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></tt><font face="Arial,Helvetica">This
monitor package originated by me, <a href="contact_author.html">Ed Sutter</a>,
and in many places both in this .html text and in the source code there
are references to the fact that I was the originator.&nbsp; While it is
still reasonable for me claim to have written the bulk of the code, there
have been several contributors to the package over the years.&nbsp; A contibutor
is not necessarily someone who has written code (although this is certainly
appreciated!), it can be a user that reports a bug or makes a suggestion
on how to improve or add to the package's capabilities and usefullness.&nbsp;
So, as you gaze through this text/code, be aware that as the number of
contributors increases, putting one name next to the term "author" is a
mis-representation of credit.&nbsp; On the other hand, if you don't like
this package, or you just think it stinks, then I didn't write any of it!</font></blockquote>
