<h1>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>SYNOPSIS:</font></font></h1>

<blockquote><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Trivial File Transfer Protocol
client/server.</font></blockquote>

<h1>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>USAGE:</font></font></h1>

<h1>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>TFTP CLIENT DESCRIPTION:</font></font></h1>

<blockquote><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The tftp command is primarily
for use by the client side of the TFTP implementation of MicroMonitor.&nbsp;
One exception to this is that the arguments <i>on</i> and <i>off</i> are
used to enable and disable (or shutdown) the tftp server (refer to the
<a href="#tftp_server">server</a>
discussion below for more details).&nbsp; This client allows the user to
transfer a file from some remote TFTP server into either RAM/DRAM space
or into a file in TFS.&nbsp; Specification of the -F option is what tells
the client that the file (after being transferred to RAM) is to be transferred
into TFS.&nbsp; By default, the file is transferred to the address specified
by the <a href="../shellvars.html#APPRAMBASE">$APPRAMBASE</a> shell variable,
but addition of the addr field overrides that default.&nbsp; Upon successful
completion of the tftp get command, the shell variable <a href="../shellvars.html#TFTPGET">$TFTPGET</a>
will be loaded with the amount of data transferred.</font>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Packet Retransmission and Timeout Process...</font></b>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Both the client and server will, under
certain circumstances, have to re-transmit a packet that may have been
lost.&nbsp; The retry mechanism is based on <a href="rfcs/rfc2131.txt">RFC2131</a>
(DHCP, section 4.1).&nbsp; The initial retry value (retransmit_delay) is
doubled until some maximum value (retransmit_delay_max) is reached.&nbsp;
At that point the delay is no longer doubled, but some final number of
retries (giveup_count) are perfomed at the rate of that last delay.&nbsp;
These three values (retransmit_delay, retransmit_delay_max and giveup_count)
have defaults but can be tuned if the shell variable <a href="../shellvars.html#TFTPRETRYTUNE">$TFTPRETRYTUNE</a>
is set.&nbsp; Note that this timeout/retry mechanism is used by DHCP, TFTP
and ARP.</font></blockquote>

SERVER DESCRIPTION:</font></font></h1>

<blockquote><font face="Arial,Helvetica">First of all...</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">For the sake of this discussion, realize
that we are referring to a situation where the server is the MicroMonitor-based
target and the client is some PC or workstation; hence, all of the "tftp"
commands mentioned in this section are done on a remote PC or workstation.&nbsp;
For transfers from target to host (<i>tftp get</i>), the source file is
on the target and the destination file is on the host; likewise, for transfers
from host to target (<i>tftp put</i>), the source file is on the host and
the destination file is on the target.</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Also...</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">When the monitor first starts up, if the
ethernet interface is active, it automatically starts up a TFTP server
and the monitor will respond to incoming TFTP requests by default.&nbsp;
The TFTP server in the monitor looks much like any other TFTP server.&nbsp;
Differences are due to the fact that the server allows the client to transfer
files several different ways.</font>
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">From host file to target file:</font></b></li>

<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The client specifies a destination that
consists of the destination file name, the flags that are to be associated
with the file and the information field that is part of the TFS header
for keeping a description of the file.&nbsp; The syntax of this destination
is comma delimited:</font>
<ul>
<ol>
<ol>
<ol>
<ol><font face="Arial,Helvetica">filename,flags,information_field</font></ol>
</ol>
</ol>
</ol>
</ul>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">All text up to the first comma is considered
the filename; text between the first comma and second comma is used as
the file flags or <a href="../tfs.html#attributes">attributes</a>, and
all text after the second comma is taken as the information field for the
TFS file.</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Notes:</font>
<ul>
<li>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">the flags field can be empty (2 commas back-to-back)
and the information_field need not be specified; or both the flags and
information_field can be omitted.&nbsp; Here are a few variations of the
above syntax:</font></li>

<li>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font></li>

<ul>
<ul>
<ul>
<ul><font face="Arial,Helvetica">filename,,information_field</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">filename,flags</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">filename</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>&nbsp;</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
</ul>

<li>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">when this transfer is actually in progress,
the file is first transferred to the location stored in the
<a href="../shellvars.html#APPRAMBASE">$APPRAMBASE</a>
shell variable; after data transfer completes, it is then copied to TFS
flash space.</font></li>

<li>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">if the file already exists in TFS, then it
will be deleted and if necessary, a defragmentation will be done.</font></li>

<li>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">if the file is ascii, then the TFTP server
will properly handle "netascii" mode for transferring to the target; the
default mode is "octet"</font></li>
</ul>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">.</font>
<li>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">From host file to target RAM:</font></b></li>

<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">If the destination file name starts with
"0x", then a file on the host can be transferred to the hex address that
follows.&nbsp; This memory space is assumed to be standard writeable RAM
or DRAM.</font>
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">From host file to destination assumed to
be in a shell variable:</font></b></li>

<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">If the destination file name starts with
a dollar sign '$' and the string following the '$' is a valid shell variable
in the monitor context, then the destination will be taken as whatever
is the content of the shell variable.&nbsp; If the shell variable does
not exist, then the destination will be that string (a filename that starts
with a '$').</font>
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">From target file to host file:</font></b></li>

<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">This is a standard transfer.&nbsp; The
file must exist in TFS, and it will be transferred to the host; otherwise,
a TFTP error message is sent to the client.</font>
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">From target memory to host file:</font></b></li>

<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">This satisfies the case where a block
of memory not necessarily part of TFS needs to transferred up to a host.&nbsp;
The source file specification is of the following syntax:</font>
<ul>
<ul>
<ul>
<ul>
<ul><font face="Arial,Helvetica">hex_address,length</font></ul>
</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">This will cause the server to transfer 'length'
bytes of data starting at 'hex_address' to the host.&nbsp; The server detects
this by seeing "0x" as the first two characters in the source filename,
and a comma somewhere later in the string.</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>&nbsp;<font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Command line examples when using a host-based
client to talk to the MicroMonitor TFTP server:</font></b>
<br><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font></b>&nbsp;
<li>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">tftp 135.3.94.136 put srcfile tfsfile,eC,Mar_30,1999@11:18</font></li>

<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Send the file "srcfile" to a target at
IP address 135.3.94.136.&nbsp; The destination filename on TFS will be
"tfsfile" with the flags eC indicating executable COFF, and the information
field will contain the string Mar_30,1999@11:18.</font>
<li>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">tftp 135.3.94.136 put srcfile 0x10400000</font></li>

<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Send the file "srcfile" to the target
at IP address 135.3.94.135.&nbsp; The destination is an address that must
be in RAM space of the target.</font>
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">tftp 135.3.94.136 put srcfile \$APPRAMBASE</font></li>

<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Send the file "srcfile" to the target
at IP address 135.3.94.135.&nbsp; The destination is the content of the
shell variable $APPRAMBASE.&nbsp; Note that the '$' is preceded by a backslash.&nbsp;
This is because we want the host shell to ignore the '$' and pass it to
the target as is.&nbsp; Obviously this, then, depends on the shell running
on the host at the time.</font>
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">tftp 135.3.94.136 put srcfile</font></li>

<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Send the file "srcfile" to the target
at IP address 135.3.94.135.&nbsp; The destination is the same filename
in TFS flash space.</font>
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">tftp 135.3.94.136 get srcfile</font></li>

<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Retrieve the file "srcfile" from the target
at IP address 135.3.94.135.&nbsp; Once on the host it will have the same
name.</font>
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">tftp 135.3.94.136 get 0x10800400,900 bdata</font></li>

<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Retrieve 900 bytes starting at location
0x10800400 and place them in the file bdata.</font></blockquote>
