<font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>DESCRIPTION:</font></font></h1>

<blockquote><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Flash is writeable non-volatile
memory.&nbsp; This command supports the handshaking necessary to erase
and write to the flash devices on the target.&nbsp; The code that makes
up the flash command in the monitor supports multiple banks of flash, and
also allows each bank to be a different bus width.&nbsp; This, of course,
is dependent on the underlying hardware.</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The flash commands support the idea of
sector protection.&nbsp; This is different than the sector protection supported
by the flash device.&nbsp; The protection provided by the flash command
is simply a 1-command window that is opened with the "flash opw" command.&nbsp;
This allows the next command to execute operations on the flash ignoring
the fact that the particular sector may be protected.&nbsp; Typically,
the monitor configures the sectors that are used by the monitor's text
and data space as protected; all other sectors are left unprotected.</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">There are several operations supported...</font>
<br>&nbsp;
<ul>
<li>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">"bank [#]"</font></li>

<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">If no argument is specified, this command
returns the currently active bank; if an argument is provided, then that
value becomes the new default bank. Note that the number of banks supported
is hardware-platform dependent.</font>
<li>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">"init"</font></li>

<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Initializes all internal flash operation
data structures (monitor development only).</font>
<li>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">"info"</font></li>

<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Queries each bank configured in the hardware
and displays the state that the monitor is assuming valid for the flash
on board.</font>
<li>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">"opw"</font></li>

<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Enables a flag that allows the very next
command to the monitor to be a flash operation that will modify the protected
sectors of the flash.&nbsp; By default the monitor knows what parts of
the flash must be protected from random writes.&nbsp; This command provides
the user with a "1-command-window" to override that protection.&nbsp; Must
be in user-level 3 mode to do this.</font>
<li>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">"erase {sector # | all}"</font></li>

<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Allows the user to erase a specified sector
of the flash or all of the non-protected sectors (all).&nbsp; The erasure
brings all bits to 1; hence the data would be read as 0xffs.</font>
<li>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">"ewrite {dest} {src} {bytecnt}"</font></li>

<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">This command allows the user (typically
only the owner of the monitor code) to re-write the protected sectors with
a new code.&nbsp; This essentially allows the monitor to re-write itself.&nbsp;
The arguments are a destination address where the data is to be written
in flash, the source address of the data to be placed in flash and the
number of bytes to be written.</font>
<li>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">"write {dest} {src} {bytecnt}"</font></li>

<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">This command allows the user write to
the flash.&nbsp; Like the ewrite command, it assumes that the data to be
written is at the location specified by "src" and the number of bytes is
specified by "bytecnt".</font></ul>

<a NAME="flash_protection"></a><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>Some
Discussion on Flash Protection:</font></font></b>
<blockquote><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The monitor does not require any hardware-implemented flash protection;
yet it still provides a reasonably secure means of protecting the flash
from accidental overwrite or erasure.&nbsp; The flash operations, as implemented
by the manufacturer,&nbsp; make it extremely unlikely that random code
would do any damage to flash; however, if you have flash on your system,
it is likely that somewhere in your instruction space there is a function
that is written to do these modifications.&nbsp; This means that a corrupt
function pointer, could potentially call the block of code that will do
damage (corrupt data) to the device.&nbsp; Obviously, the monitor has these
functions.&nbsp; But with the functions comes a requirement that a previous
function be called to modify a flag that must be set for the "dangerous"
function to do the damage.&nbsp; This means that two things must "accidentally"
happen in the proper sequence:</font>
<ol>
<li>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">The flag must be modified</font></li>

<li>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">The function that does the flash operation
must be called</font></li>
</ol>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">The likelihood of this occurring greatly decreases
the chances of messing up your flash.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
There is the option of using some kind of hardware protection, and there
are several different ways this can be implemented.&nbsp; A lot of the
variation is caused by the fact that different devices offer different
types of protection and mechanisms to temporarily "unprotect" sectors.&nbsp;&nbsp;
The following list is in order based on the amount of the flash device
that actually needs the hardware protection and does not consider the temporary
"unprotect" mode that some newer devices now have...</font>
<ul>
<li>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Protect the entire device</font></b></li>

<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">This is obviously the safest, but it also
defeats the whole purpose behind using flash.&nbsp;&nbsp; The device would
be programmed in the factory with a monitor and the files to be in TFS
space.&nbsp; The monitor and TFS files would be unchangeable.&nbsp; If
there is no intent to ever change things, then do this.</font>
<li>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Protect the monitor space and the first
few sectors of TFS space</font></b></li>

<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Similar to the above case, the monitor
and some of the space allocated to TFS (based on a sector boundary) can
be protected.&nbsp; Perhaps a backup application and the monrc file would
be in the protected TFS space, then the remaining space would be open for
update.&nbsp; This locks in some base application that could run if all
else failed.</font>
<li>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Protect the monitor space only</font></b></li>

<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">This would allow the application to be
upgradeable in the field, without fear of ever losing total control of
a system because worst case scenerio the monitor would be able take over
and allow the system to be re-established regardless of the level of corruption
that has occurred in the non-protected sectors of the flash.&nbsp; The
only disadvantage to this (as with the one above this) is that the monitor
itself cannot be updated.</font>
<li>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Protect a boot-sector</font></b></li>

<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">With this model, the monitor is built
as two separate pieces: a boot-sector startup and the monitor itself.&nbsp;
Here the only piece of code that is hardware protected is a small boot-sector
that would contain a crc32 checker and xmodem (or a not-yet-implemented
tftp) downloader...&nbsp; It would boot the hardware and immediatly do
a check to see if the monitor is sane... If it is, then jump into it; if
it isn't, then prompt the user for a new monitor and wait there forever.&nbsp;
Once a new monitor is downloaded into RAM it can be used to rebuild the
corrupted flash. This allows the monitor to be safely upgraded in the field
without fear of losing the system if the upgrade fails for some reason.&nbsp;
It also allows the flash to be programmed and protected in bulk without
losing the ability to upgrade the monitor and all the applications in TFS.</font>
<li>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">No hardware protection at all</font></b></li>

<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">This model works fine, but it is a little
risky.&nbsp; There is the chance that the boot code can be corrupted (and
if it was, the system would need to come back to the factory or lab); but,
as discussed above, it is extremely unlikely and depending on the project,
the above options may not be worth the added overhead of sector-protecting
some of the device in the factory.</font></ul>
