Shell Variable Usage</font></h2>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font face="Arial,Helvetica">Similar
to most other shells, shell variable names can contain alphanumerics and
the underscore ('_').&nbsp; Once assigned, the value within the variable
can be accessed by preceding the variable name with a dollar sign ($).&nbsp;
The ${} syntax is also supported.&nbsp; Use of the curly braces tells the
command line processor to force the start and end point of a shell variable
name that may otherwise not be seen as a variable because it is embedded
within a larger string of characters.&nbsp; In addition, the dollar sign
can be preceded by a backslash to negate its meaning as a shell variable
starting delimiter.&nbsp; The <a href="commands/set.html">set</a> command
supports the ability to assign values to variable names and perform some
basic operation on them.</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The MicroMonitor command interpreter supports nested shell variable names.&nbsp;
This means that the user can build a shell variable name based on other
shell variables.&nbsp; For example, if NAME_1 contains "Jane",&nbsp; NAME_2
contains "John" and IDX contains "1"&nbsp; then the statement echo&nbsp;
${NAME_${IDX}}&nbsp; will output the string "Jane"; likewise if IDX contains
"2" then that same statement will output the string "John".&nbsp; This
mechanism of processing nested shell variables within the command line
interface allows the user to conveniently use shell variables to represent
n-dimensional arrays, and by default, only the space used by the individual
members within each dimension take up memory space. For example,&nbsp;
assume we have an application that is represented by 3 entries in a table
and the entries may exist in any of the first 100 locations of the table.&nbsp;
When the entries are created they use the index into the table as part
of their name: TBL3, TBL48, TBL99.&nbsp; Then the user can"index" into
the table with a second IDX variable...&nbsp; ${TBL${IDX}} where IDX is
set to 3, 48 or 99 will retrieve the content of each variable.&nbsp; Note
that although the application appears to have a table that contains at
least 100 entries, the shell actually only assigns those that are used.&nbsp;
A multi-dimensional array is handled the same way... PLOT[3][4][5] can
be represented with&nbsp; the shell variable PLOT345 ... ${PLOT${X}${Y}${Z}},
where X=3, Y=4 and Z=5.</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
For examples of this usage refer to the <a href="scripts.html#namelist">namelist</a>
and <a href="scripts.html#why_do_this">why would you ever want to do this?</a>

Shell Variables vs. Symbols</font></h2>

<blockquote><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The command line processor makes token substitutions based on shell variable
assignment and symbol table entries.&nbsp; As previously mentioned, shell
variables are identified by preceding a string with a dollar sign ($).&nbsp;
Symbol table entries are identified by preceding a string with a percent
sign (%).&nbsp; The use of shell variables and symbols is similar, but
the way in which they are stored is different; hence, either may be appropriate
depending on the situation.</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
A shell variable is created on the command line of the monitor using the
<a href="commands/set.html">set</a>
command or through the API using the
<a href="api/setenv.html">setenv()</a>
function.&nbsp; Retrieval of the content on the command line is done by
specifying the variable name preceded by a dollar sign ($) or through the
API using the <a href="api/getenv.html">getenv()</a> function.&nbsp; Refer
to the discussion on <a href="scripts.html">scripts</a> for some examples
of shell variable usage.</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
A symbol is not created, it exists or it doesn't exist based on the content
of a symbol table file in TFS.&nbsp; Retrieval of the content of a symbol
on the command line is done by specifying the symbol name preceded by a
percent sign (%).&nbsp; There is no "getenv()-like" capability for symbols.&nbsp;
The default name for the symbol table file is "symtbl".&nbsp; At compile
time, this can be overridden in config.h, or at runtime if the shell variable
SYMFILE is set, then the content of that shell variable is used instead
of the default "symtbl".&nbsp; The format of the symbol table file is simple,
each line contains one symbol with a value that the symbol represents (each
of which are whitespace delimited).&nbsp; For example, if the following
lines were in the file "symtbl"...</font>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote><tt>main&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0x14004</tt>
<br><tt>func&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0x14800</tt></blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">then if %main was on the command line, it
would be replaced with 0x14004; likewise if %func was on the command line,
it would be replaced with 0x14800.&nbsp;&nbsp; This symbol-table querying
ability allows the stand-alone monitor to provide symbolic querying of
the application without the need for a host-resident debugger; plus, when
it is no longer needed, the symbol file can simply be removed from TFS.&nbsp;
As an example of symbol table substitution, the following command line&nbsp;
&ocirc;dm -4d %symname&ouml; would be converted to something like &ocirc;dm
-4d 0x401008&ouml; if the symbol table file existed and there was an entry
for &ocirc;symname&ouml;. Likewise, the following command line &ocirc;arp
$HOSTIP&ouml; would be converted to &ocirc;arp 135.3.94.39&ouml; if the
shell variable &ocirc;HOSTIP&ouml; was previously set to &ocirc;135.3.94.39&ouml;.</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The primary difference between shell variables and symbols is the way in
which they are stored.&nbsp; Shell variables are allocated onto the heap
so they use up RAM, symbol table entries are part of a file, so no RAM
is involved.&nbsp; Also, future versions of MicroMonitor may support more
complex symbol retrieval by allowing a symbol to have members (a structure).</font>
<br><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">NOTE1:</font></b>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The command interpreter can be told not
to process the dollar sign by preceding it with the backslash (\).&nbsp;
For example, assuming the shell variable $ABC is set to "hello", the command
line "echo \$ABC = $ABC" could be used to output "$ABC = hello".</font>
<br><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">NOTE2:</font></b>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">At the point in time when the command
interpreter is making the substitution of the value of a variable in place
of the variable name itself, if the variable does not exist, then no substitution
is made.&nbsp; For example, if the shell variable ABC was previously set
to "hello" then the command line "echo $ABC" would print out "hello"; but
if the shell variable ABC was not previously set to anything, then the
line "echo $ABC" would print out "$ABC".&nbsp; For scripting then, a comparison
can be made to determine if a shell variable exists in the current monitor
environment:&nbsp; if $ABC seq&nbsp; \$ABC goto VARS_DOESNT_EXIST.</font>
<br><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">NOTE3:</font></b>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The logic of notes 1 &amp; 2 above applies
to symbols as well as variables.</font></blockquote>

Implementation</font></h2>

<blockquote><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The monitor stores shell variables in a simple linked list.&nbsp; As each
variable is created, space is allocated for the list itself (if there is
no free slot), and the actual shell variable data.&nbsp; If a variable
is removed, the name and value is freed, but the slot in the linked list
is just marked as available for storage.&nbsp; There is no practical limitation
on the size of the variable content or the variable name.&nbsp; Symbols
are part of a TFS file, so there is similar flexibility as with shell variables.</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
When making command line substitution, the shell variable processing is
done prior to tokenization (building a char *argv[] array) of the command
string.&nbsp; The expanded command line cannot exceed 127 characters.</font></blockquote>

Variables Created and/or Used by MicroMonitor</font></h2>

<ul><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
When the monitor starts up, it looks for the presence of certain shell
variables to configure itself (see description of <a href="startup.html#Stage_1">monrc</a>
file as an example); also, it sets up some shell variables to be used by
scripts or application code for various purposes.&nbsp; Following is a
list of the shell variables intrinsic to the monitor:</font>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<ul>
<li>
<a NAME="APPRAMBASE"></a><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">APPRAMBASE</font></b></li>

<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">This shell variable is loaded with the
starting point of the RAM space that is made available to the application.&nbsp;
This typically starts on some modulo 0x100 boundary (or larger), just above
the end of RAM space that is used by the monitor itself.&nbsp; Note that
this variable is automatically loaded by the monitor at startup.&nbsp;
Certain facilities within the monitor use this value as a pointer to memory
that is assumed to be "accessible".&nbsp; This is important to be aware
of, so here are the facilities that make this assumption: <i>edit, tftp
server, tfs cp, xmodem receive, simple version of tfsclean</i>.&nbsp; The
value can be modified, and the modified value will then be used by these
facilities, but make sure you know what you're doing!</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">In general, its intent is to provide a
common means of accessing the address that has been loaded into it by the
monitor.</font>

the actual starting point of the flash is but still transfer data to it.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Note that this variable is automatically loaded by the monitor at startup.&nbsp;
