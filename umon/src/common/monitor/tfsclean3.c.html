/* tfsclean3.c:
 *
 *  --- NOT READY YET ---
 *
 *  This version of defragmentation is power-hit safe and requires
 *  that there be double the amount of flash as is needed for use by
 *  TFS.  The basic idea is similar to tfsclean2.c...
 *  Copy all of the good files over to the "other" flash bank, then have
 *  TFS use the "other" bank as the storage area.
 *  The idea is that the defrag is simply a copy of the good stuff to
 *  the alternate flash block.  This requires that after the
 *  good stuff is copied, the now-dirty flash block must be erased in
 *  the background prior to the next tfsclean() call.  The fact that
 *  there is no sector erase is what makes this faster.
 *
 *  If both of these flash banks are in the same flash device, then
 *  having a background erase in progress means that it must be an
 *  interruptible erase (device specific).  This is necessary because
 *  while the background erase is in progress there may be a need to
 *  interact with the flash and most devices don't let you do both at the
 *  same time.
 *  
 *  Note that this "background-erase" is what makes this method the
 *  fastest defrag method.  It does require that the erase operation be
 *  interruptible, and it requires that the application will provide the
 *  hooks to do this...
 *
 *  General notice:
 *  This code is part of a boot-monitor package developed as a generic base
 *  platform for embedded system designs.  As such, it is likely to be
 *  distributed to various projects beyond the control of the original
 *  author.  Please notify the author of any enhancements made or bugs found
 *  so that all may benefit from the changes.  In addition, notification back
 *  to the author will allow the new user to pick up changes that may have
 *  been made by other users after this version of the code was distributed.
 *
 *  Note1: the majority of this code was edited with 4-space tabs.
 *  Note2: as more and more contributions are accepted, the term "author"
 *         is becoming a mis-representation of credit.
