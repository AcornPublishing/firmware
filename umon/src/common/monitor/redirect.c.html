/* redirect:
 *  This code supports the monitor's ability to redirect what was destined for
 *  the console to a block of memory in RAM.  Enough data is maintained so
 *  that the block of memory can be transferred to a file using tfsadd().
 *
 *  Description of redirection CLI syntax:
 *        buffer_addr,buffer_size[,filename]
 *       [filename]
 *
 *  - Single arrow starts up a redirection to some specified block of memory
 *    with a specified size.  If the filename is specified, then the output
 *    of that single command is redirected to the buffer then transferred to
 *    the specified file in TFS.  Any previously existent file of the same
 *    name is overwritten.
 *
 *  - Double arrow with no argument says append output of this command to
 *    the previously established buffer.
 *
 *  - Double arrow with an argument says append output of this command to
 *    the previously established buffer and then write that buffer to the
 *    specified filename.  Once again, any previously existent file of the
 *    same name is overwritten.
 *
 *  General notice:
 *  This code is part of a boot-monitor package developed as a generic base
 *  platform for embedded system designs.  As such, it is likely to be
 *  distributed to various projects beyond the control of the original
 *  author.  Please notify the author of any enhancements made or bugs found
 *  so that all may benefit from the changes.  In addition, notification back
 *  to the author will allow the new user to pick up changes that may have
 *  been made by other users after this version of the code was distributed.
 *
 *  Note1: the majority of this code was edited with 4-space tabs.
 *  Note2: as more and more contributions are accepted, the term "author"
 *         is becoming a mis-representation of credit.
