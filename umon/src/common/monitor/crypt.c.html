/* Simple one-way encryption function:
 *  Use 256 bytes of random data as a very simple means of encrypting some
 *  data.  The result can be a maximum size of twice the incoming string.
 *
 *  If a character from the incoming string has either '00000110' bits set,
 *  then use that character twice.  This allows the encrypted string
 *  to be a varying length based on the content of the string.
 *
 *  Use the first two characters of "setting" plus the checksum of the 
 *  characters pointed to by result as the initial offset into the data table.
 *  This makes is less likely that passwords with similar starting characters
 *  will have similar starting characters in the encrypted result.
 *
 *  NOTE that originally this function could be replaced with the crypt()
 *  that is part of the BSD source code through use of the INCLUDE_CRYPT
 *  macro in config.h.  I eliminated that in this source so that distribution
 *  becomes less complicated.  If you see the need for using the UNIX crypt()
 *  grab it from some BSD distribution and modify it so that the result is
 *  a pointer passed into the function.
 *
 *  This function is coordinated with the maccrypt.exe tool that comes
 *  with the monitor.  It contains the same array as is defined below.
 *  If you really plan to use this in a project that needs some password
 *  encryption; I strongly recommend that you at least change the content
 *  of the datatbl defined below and in maccrypt.c.
 *
 *  General notice:
 *  This code is part of a boot-monitor package developed as a generic base
 *  platform for embedded system designs.  As such, it is likely to be
 *  distributed to various projects beyond the control of the original
 *  author.  Please notify the author of any enhancements made or bugs found
 *  so that all may benefit from the changes.  In addition, notification back
 *  to the author will allow the new user to pick up changes that may have
 *  been made by other users after this version of the code was distributed.
 *
 *  Note1: the majority of this code was edited with 4-space tabs.
 *  Note2: as more and more contributions are accepted, the term "author"
 *         is becoming a mis-representation of credit.
