/* inc_check.h:
 * 
 *  This is an include file used to verify that all of the monitor macros
 *  are defined.  There is also some attempt to verify that macro conflicts
 *  do not exist (for example, the flash file system cannot exist if the
 *  flash driver is not included); however, there are probably holes in this
 *  check.
 * 
 *  Following is a brief description of what each macro includes if set to
 *  non-zero...
 *
 *  INCLUDE_MEMCMDS:
 *      Memory display, modification and test commands.  The included as a 
 *      result of setting this macro is primarily found in memcmds.c.
 *  INCLUDE_PIO:
 *      Parallel IO commands.  Most of the microprocessors that this monitor
 *      has been ported to has some set of pins that can be configured as
 *      parallel IO or general-purpose IO.  Setting this macro would include
 *      the code that is behind the pio command.
 *  INCLUDE_EDIT:
 *      An ascii file editor.  This is an on-board file editor that provides
 *      the system with the ability to edit files in TFS.  Refer to edit.c
 *      for details of this functionality.  This obviously assumes that TFS
 *      and the FLASH drivers are also enabled.
 *  INCLUDE_DEBUG:
 *      On some of the monitor ports I have single-stepping, breakpoints etc..
 *      working.  This macro would enable those commands and capabilities.
 *  INCLUDE_DISASSEMBLER:
 *      This pulls in a disassembler.
 *  INCLUDE_UNPACK:
 *  INCLUDE_UNZIP:
 *      These two macros define one of two different mechanisms for
 *      decompression of executables in TFS.  UNPACK is huffman and UNZIP
 *      is the public domain zlib stuff.  Huffman is a small addition to the
 *      monitor size but only provides about 15% compression.  The zlib stuff
 *      is a bit larger and needs more RAM for malloc() but it does a MUCH
 *      better job of compression.  I've seen as high as 75% of the file size
 *      compressed.  It is illegal to set both of these macros.
 *  INCLUDE_ETHERNET:
 *      This pulls in the basic ethernet drivers with ARP, and some of the
 *      lowest level ethernet interface code.
 *  INCLUDE_TFTP:
 *      This pulls in a TFTP client and server (obviously assumes ETHERNET
 *      is also pulled in).
 *  INCLUDE_DHCPBOOT:
 *      This pulls in a DHCP/BOOTP client (also assumes ETHERNET
 *      is also pulled in).
 *  INCLUDE_TFS:
 *  INCLUDE_TFSAPI:
 *  INCLUDE_TFSAUTODEFRAG:
 *  INCLUDE_TFSSYMTBL:
 *  INCLUDE_TFSSCRIPT:
 *  INCLUDE_TFSCLI:
 *      The above TFS macros allow the monitor to be built with varying degrees
 *      of FFS capability depending on the needs of the system.  INCLUDE_TFS
 *      is required by all others and is the minimum TFS hookup.  It provides
 *      the minimum set of TFS facilities such as autoboot, use of a monrc file
 *      for startup config, and defragmentation.  TFSAPI pulls in the TFS 
 *      code that allows an application to hook into TFS's capabilities in
 *      code-space.  TFSCLI pulls in the TFS command at the command line 
 *      interface.  TFSSAFEDEFRAG pulls in the power-safe defragmenation
 *      (otherwise a simpler, less robust mechanism is used).
 *      TFSSYMTBL pulls in the symbol-table functionality and TFSSCRIPT
 *      pulls in the CLI commands that are normally associated with scripts.
 *  INCLUDE_XMODEM:
 *      Pull in Xmodem.
 *  INCLUDE_LINEEDIT:
 *      Pull in a command line editor and history facility.
 *  INCLUDE_EE:
 *      Pull in an expression evaluator for the CLI.
 *      Note that this is not included with the public distribution.
 *  INCLUDE_FLASH:
 *      Pull in the flash drivers.
 *  INCLUDE_CRYPT:
 *      Pull in UNIX crypt() instead of a simpler encryption scheme I wrote.
 *      Note that this is not included with the public distribution.
 *  INCLUDE_GDB:
 *      Pull in the "gdb" command.  This is an incomplete facility that
 *      will eventually allow the monitor to hook up to a gdb debugger.
 *  INCLUDE_STRACE:
 *      Pull in the "strack trace" command. 
 *  INCLUDE_CAST:
 *      Pull in the "cast" command for complex structure display at the
 *      CLI.
 *  INCLUDE_EXCTEST:
 *      Pull in  a command tha tcan be used to test the exception handler
 *      built into the monitor.
 *  INCLUDE_IDEV:
 *      This pulls in the idev (device interface) command.
 *  INCLUDE_REDIRECT:
 *      This pulls in the code that allows the monitor's CLI to redirect
 *      command output to a TFS file.
 *  INCLUDE_QUICKMEMCPY:
 *      This pulls in some faster memcpy stuff in genlib.c.
 *  INCLUDE_PROFILER:
 *      This pulls in some code and a CLI command that provides an
 *      application with some task and function level profiling.
 *  INCLUDE_BBC:
 *      This pulls in some code and a CLI command that provides an
 *      application with a basic ability to organize basic block coverage
 *      verification.
 *  INCLUDE_MEMTRACE:
 *      This pulls in a simple memory trace capability.  It's a simple
 *      printf()-like function with data logged to RAM instead of a UART.
