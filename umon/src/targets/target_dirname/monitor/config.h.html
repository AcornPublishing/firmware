 * General notice:
 * This code is part of a boot-monitor package developed as a generic base
 * platform for embedded system designs.  As such, it is likely to be
 * distributed to various projects beyond the control of the original
 * author.  Please notify the author of any enhancements made or bugs found
 * so that all may benefit from the changes.  In addition, notification back
 * to the author will allow the new user to pick up changes that may have
 * been made by other users after this version of the code was distributed.
