<blockquote><font face="Arial,Helvetica">One of the design goals of this
monitor package was to make it simple to port to new processors and target
hardware.&nbsp; There are a few things in the monitor (timing in particular)
which suffer a bit just to keep the porting effort to a minimum. The two
most significant points are...</font>
<ul>
<li>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The monitor does not use any interrupts
from the CPU</font></b></li>

<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">From the porting point of view this is
a real luxury.&nbsp; It makes it much easier to get a port to a new processor
up and running.&nbsp; You don't have to worry about how a processor's interrupt
handler mechanism is set up and you don't have to worry about making sure
you save all the registers appropirately.&nbsp; Additionally, the serial
port and ethernet drivers are much less complex because everything is polled.&nbsp;
Not having interrupts means that it is a bit more difficult (and somewhat
inaccurate) to deal with elapsed time.&nbsp; If you have no clock reference,
then you don't really know how much time has passed; however, to get around
this a bit, there is a calibration that is made by the "sleep" command
that allows you to tweek this timing a bit.&nbsp; Still, it is admittedly
inaccurate, but worth it.&nbsp; Keep in mind that the drivers in the monitor
are not intended to be reused by the application anyway.&nbsp; If the overlaying
application needs a real driver, then that application needs to provide
it.</font>
<li>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The monitor code assumes that initialized
data is not writeable</font></b></li>

<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">For bootup, the code is running out of
flash which is non-volatile.&nbsp; The monitor does not copy any .data
space to ram, so it too is accessed in runtime from flash.&nbsp; This means
that the monitor's initialized data is not writeable.&nbsp; Yep, this is
something to be aware of; but, once again, it makes the port much easier
because now there is no need to figure out how the compiler toolset allows
the data section to be remapped to ram space and there is no need to copy
the data section into ram space.&nbsp; On the other hand, the monitor DOES
assume that on startup the .bss section is initialized to zero.&nbsp; This
is ok because it is easy to clear a block of memory regardless of the toolset.</font></ul>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Porting details...</font></b>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">There are 4 sections of code within the
monitor that need to be modified when porting to a new target.&nbsp; Based
on the ports already available, some of these sections may be re-usable
from other ports that have already been made, so it is wise to check with
the <a href="mailto:esutter@lucent.com">author</a> prior to starting this
work.</font>
<ul>
<li>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">Code to handle CPU reset, basic exception
handling and getting up to 'C' level (see <a href="../src/targets/target_dirname/monitor/reset.s.html">reset.s</a>
and <a href="../src/common/monitor/start.c.html">start.c</a>).</font></li>

<li>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">Code for a polled serial port driver (see
<a href="../src/targets/target_dirname/monitor/cpuio.c.html">cpuio.c</a>).</font></li>

<li>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">Code for a&nbsp; flash device driver (see
<a href="../src/common/flash/flash_dirname/flashdev.c.html">flashdev.c</a>
and <a href="../src/common/flash/flash_dirname/flashpic.c.html">flashpic.c</a>).</font></li>

<li>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">Code for a polled ethernet driver (see <a href="../src/targets/target_dirname/monitor/etherdev.c.html">etherdev.c</a>).</font></li>
</ul>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">There are currently two top-level directories
that contain the code... the <a href="../src/common">common</a> directory
and the <a href="../src/targets">target-specific</a> directory.&nbsp; The&nbsp;
code under the common directory should be left untouched.&nbsp; Those files
have been designed to interface to the target-specific code found under
the targets/<i>targetname</i>/monitor (where <i>targetname</i> is the name
of some target platform) directory and the common/flash/<i>flashname</i>
(where <i>flashname</i> is some flash device name) directory.&nbsp;&nbsp;
The only exception to this rule is if you are writing a new flash driver;
then, a new common/flash/<i>new_flashname</i> directory would be created
and the new drivers would be written similar to one of the existing flash
device drivers.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">When starting a port, retrieve the latest
tar file from the author and copy it to some workspace.&nbsp; Change the
name of the target-specific directory.&nbsp; Change the name to something
that contains an acronym for your target followed by a string representing
the CPU (ie.. abcsh2 is the ABC board with the Hitachi SH2 processor).&nbsp;
Also, under the common directory, if you will be writing a new flash device
driver, change the name of the directory containing the flash code to the
name of the device you are going to be using.&nbsp; For the sake of this
discussion, let's assume the target-specific directory name is ABC960 and
the common/flash directory is 29XX32.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">At this point we are ready to start modifying
code.&nbsp; The first thing to do is to reduce the complexity of the monitor
by turning off the majority of the features established by the ABC960/monitor/config.h
file.&nbsp; In this file there is a block of INCLUDE_<i>FEATURE</i> macros
(where <i>FEATURE</i> is some feature-specific string).&nbsp; Following
is what can be used as the minimal configuration...</font>

<font face="Arial,Helvetica">This configuration provides a very basic monitor...
a serial port driver with xmodem for download and memory commands for interfacing
to target memory.&nbsp; Refer to the file <a href="../src/common/monitor/inc_check.h.html">inc_check.h</a>
for the most up-to-date list of these definitions and their meaning. The
files that need the work now are reset.s and cpuio.c.&nbsp; If this is
the first attempt at this processor, then spend some time looking for some
example code from the CPU manufacturer's website.&nbsp; This is usually
not too hard to find.&nbsp; For the very first build attempt, don't even
worry about the exception handlers.&nbsp; Once this is working, then add
the exception handling stuff found in ABC960/monitor/except.c and ABC960/monitor/vectors.s.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">At this point, you have a basic monitor
working.&nbsp; Next, enable INCLUDE_FLASH and start working on the files
under common/29XX32.&nbsp; Use the current code as a model. You can use
XMODEM to download small programs and run them by executing the "<a href="../commands/call.html">cal</a>l"
comand.&nbsp; Once the flash driver is operational, the <a href="../commands/xmodem.html">Xmodem
-B</a> command can be used to download new monitor binaries without the
need for an external programmer.&nbsp;&nbsp; After that, enable INCLUDE_TFS
and the file system stuff will be active.&nbsp; Note that there are a few
additional configuration macros in config.h that must be established for
TFS, plus look at ABC960/monitor/tfsdev.h to configure each of the flash
devices within TFS.&nbsp; The final step is to enable INCLUDE_ETHERNET
and work on the code in etherdev.c.&nbsp;&nbsp; At this point, since you
have a working monitor with TFS, you can download small applications that
include your ethernet code to conveniently test it out.&nbsp; That will
give you the ethernet interface.&nbsp; Once this works, all of the other
macros can be enabled as needed and the port is completed.</font>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">A few hints...</font></b>
<ul>
<li>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">It is important to <b>take little steps</b>
when doing a port.&nbsp; The config.h INCLUDE_XXX macros allow you to do
this.&nbsp; Don't try to build the whole platform in one shot.&nbsp; One
step at a time will get you there a lot faster!!!</font></li>

<li>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">Don't even enable cache if your CPU has it.&nbsp;
Just leave it off until you have the port complete and you build up some
confidence in what you have.</font></li>

<li>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">In all of the driver polling loops insert
some type of timeout.&nbsp; If the timeout occurs, depending on where it
occurs, you can do a few different things: if the timeout occurs in a UART-related
poll, then blink an LED, or do SOMETHING to let the outside world know
where the code is.&nbsp; If the timeout occurs somewhere after the uart
interface is known to be up and running, then call some simple error message
that will print out the serial port.</font></li>

<li>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">In the start() function, make sure that ramstart
&amp; ramend variables are properly pointing to the beginning and end of
the monitor-owned .bss space.&nbsp; Also, when first bringing up a new
port, force this bss initialization to be done by defining the FORCE_BSS_INIT
macro in config.h.</font></li>
</ul>
