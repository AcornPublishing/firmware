Startup Sequence</font></h2>

<blockquote><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There
can potentially be multiple stages of startup in a system that uses MicroMonitor
as its base platform.&nbsp; The initial stage is for the monitor itself
and all subsequent stages are established by the user based on the content
of <a href="tfs.html#attributes">auto-bootable files</a> found in TFS.&nbsp;
This page discusses the initial stage and an example stage 2.</font></blockquote>

<h2>
<a href="#top"><img SRC="images/top.gif" NOSAVE height=20 width=20></a><a NAME="Stage_1"></a><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Stage
1: The monrc file</font></h2>

<blockquote><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
In this stage, the system is taken from a hard reset state to a point where
it is able to communicate with a host to retrieve system configuration
information or it may just startup in a standalone mode with all the configuration
parameters it needs on-board.&nbsp; After a hard-reset, the monitor firmware
runs the lowest levels of initialization, and prior to starting its peripherals,
it attempts to execute a&nbsp; script file called "monrc".&nbsp; This file,
like any other run-control file, is used to allow the monitor to establish
some of its basic configuration at startup.&nbsp; It allows the same monitor
program to start up in different ways based on the content of the file.&nbsp;
The monrc file is automatically executed by the monitor in the early stages
of system startup.&nbsp; It is the only executable file in TFS that is
automatically executed at startup despite the fact that it is not flagged
as an auto-bootable file.&nbsp; Typically, the only thing that is in this
file is a few <i><a href="commands/set.html">set</a></i> commands.&nbsp;
They are used to establish things like the IP and MAC addresses (shell
variable names: IPADD and ETHERADD respectively); but other things (like
a <i><a href="commands/sleep.html">sleep</a> -l,</i> setting <i><a href="commands/pio.html">pio</a></i>
lines, etc) can be put in the monrc file so that the board boots up with
its own personality without the need to recompile a unique monitor per
system.&nbsp;<b> It is&nbsp; important to be aware of the fact that when
the monitor executes the monrc file it is still in the process of initializing
itself.</b>&nbsp; The monitor has not yet turned up its own ethernet interface
(the ethernet driver will use the content of shell variables ETHERADD and
IPADD to configure itself), so the monrc file should contain only the most
basic startup sequences as mentioned above, anything beyond this basic
stuff should be done with an auto-bootable script, outside the context
of monrc execution.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The value loaded into the IPADD shell variable is typically going to be
some IP address, but the monitor also supports automatic boot-up using
BOOTP or DHCP (automatic allocation mode only).&nbsp; If the content of
IPADD is the string "DHCP", then the monitor will broadcast a DHCP_DISCOVER
request.&nbsp; If the content of the IPADD shell variable is the string
"BOOTP", then the monitor will initiate a BOOTP broadcast.&nbsp; The monitor
can be built to run a <a href="commands/dhcp.html">DHCP client</a> in several
different ways.&nbsp; With either DHCP or BOOTP, the result of the handshake
is that some shell variables are loaded and possibly a file has been downloaded
and executed.&nbsp; Note that for both the "DHCP" and "BOOTP" string loaded
into the IPADD shell variable, if the character 'v' or 'V' is appended
to the string (ie.. DHCPv, DHCPV, BOOTPv or BOOTPV) a low (v) or high (V)
level of verbosity is enabled during the DHCP/BOOTP handshake.&nbsp; One
final note regarding the IPADD shell variable...&nbsp; if it is loaded
with "0.0.0.0", this tells the monitor to not startup the ethernet driver
at all.&nbsp; It can then be restarted later in a script by re-assigning
the IPADD shell variable and issuing the "ether on" and (optionally) the
"dhcp" commands.</font></blockquote>

<blockquote><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
During development, we usually don't need (or want) the BOOTP/DHCP server
to complicate things, so the monrc file would be loaded with a real IP
address (along with <a href="shellvars.html#shellvars_used">all of the
other environment variables that are typically established by DHCP or BOOTP</a>)
and the board doesn't use DHCP.&nbsp; <i>Note that this is all configurable
based on the content of this small ASCII file resident on the target, there
is no recompilation of the monitor or application to acquire the per-board
uniqueness.</i>&nbsp; Following are a few example monrc files with shell
variable settings that apply to specific applications...</font>
<h4>
<i><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Monrc file example #1</font></i></h4>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
This example establishes the information needed by the Packet Phone Adapter
for configuration without the requirement of a DHCP server (note that the
IPADD setting is an IP address, not the DHCP string).</font>

<font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
This example establishes the basic bootup information needed by the target
so that it retrieves its configuration information from the DHCP server.&nbsp;
Note that the DHCP client code that comes with the monitor is in two parts:
generic code and application specific hooks.&nbsp; For the PPA, there are
hooks added to support the retrieval of several different vendor-specific
options unique to the PPA application.&nbsp; The mechanism used by the
PPA, although specific to that application, is very re-usable for other
sets of vendor-specific options, and this code is available for reference.&nbsp;
The current DHCP client code is set up so that in most cases there is no
need to modify the monitor source code; howerver, if source code modification
is necessary, then hooks have been installed into the common code (<a href="src/common/monitor/dhcpboot.c.html">dhcpboot.c</a>)
that allow the user to add target-specific extensions&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(<a href="src/common/monitor/dhcp_00.c.html">dhcp_00.c</a>) without touching
the common source code.</font>

2: A top level startup script</font></h2>

<blockquote><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Once the monitor has run the monrc file, it will then complete its own
initialization based on the presence (or lack of) <a href="shellvars.html#shellvars_used">shell
variables</a>.&nbsp; The monitor will then run through the files in TFS
looking for any other auto-bootable, executable file. In the case of the
PPA, the only auto-bootable file will be the PPAgo script.&nbsp; Using
the <a href="scripts.html">scripting capabilities of the monitor</a>, the
PPAgo file is the top-level application file resident on the PPA.&nbsp;
The actual PPA application code is not even auto-bootable; rather, it is
started up through this auto-bootable PPAgo script.&nbsp; The script is
responsible for completion of the DHCP handshake, getting the current ICMP
timestamp, determining if the current application resident on the PPA is
up to date; and if not, kicking off a TFTP transfer to get the latest one.</font>

<blockquote><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
As discussed above, the monitor will look to the monrc file for boot-up
parameters.&nbsp; If the monitor boots up and does not find a monrc file,
it will make one additional attempt at it by looking for "monrc.bak".&nbsp;
This is done to provide protection from the cases where a system is updating
its monrc file... While updating it, copy the old version to monrc.bak,
then if somehow the target crashes in the middle of the update, the monitor
will still have the monrc.bak file to boot from.</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
What happens if both monrc and monrc.bak do not exist?&nbsp; The flash
used by the file system is not necessarily protected; hence, there is the
possibility of the monitor booting up and TFS being empty or the monrc
file just not being there.&nbsp; Assuming the target has an ethernet interface,
the two most important parameters that the target must get from somewhere
are the MAC address and IP address.&nbsp;&nbsp; For the MAC address, there
will probably be some non-volatile storage device (typically serial EEPROM)
that will be loaded with the MAC address, so assuming the hardware is functional,
even if the monrc file exists, in a final product, the MAC address is retrieved
from some peripheral, not the monrc file (see
<a href="#factory_mac">MAC
storage discussion</a> below).&nbsp; If however, there is no MAC address
stored, then the last-resort MAC address can be a hard-coded value that
is either a MAC address or a string indicating that the target is to startup
with ethernet disabled (see DEFAULT_ETHERADD in <a href="src/targets/target_dirname/monitor/config.h.html">config.h</a>).&nbsp;
For the IP address, the monitor can be configured to run with a hard-coded
(see DEFAULT_IPADD in <a href="src/targets/target_dirname/monitor/config.h.html">config.h</a>)
IP address, BOOTP or DHCP.&nbsp; Following is a discussion of each of these
modes...</font>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Fixed IP Address Startup</font></b>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The monitor can be configured to simply boot up with a fixed IP address
as a last resort.&nbsp; If this is the case, then there is no server interaction
at boot up, the monitor simply starts up with the default MAC and IP addresses.&nbsp;
The DEFAULT_IPADD macro in config.h must be set to the appropriate IP address
as a string.</font>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Ethernet Disabled at Startup</font></b>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The monitor can be configured to simply boot up the ethernet interface
disabled.&nbsp; The bootup will post a warning at the console and all ethernet
activity is disabled.&nbsp; This is done by setting the DEFAULT_ETHERADD
macro in config.h to "ETHER_OFF".</font>

installed MAC address</font></h2>

<blockquote><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The convenient (during development) mechanism used to assign MAC addresses
to each target is through the monrc file using the ETHERADD shell variable.&nbsp;
This is adequate during field trials and application development but it
is impractical when a large number of targets are deployed.&nbsp; As mentioned
above, the hardware will typically have some non-volatile storage device
that allows the MAC address to be stored away.&nbsp; Following is a discussion
on some different techniques that have been considered for a factory-installed
MAC (and possibly IP) address.</font>
<ul>
<li>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">DALLAS Semiconductor UNIQUEWARE (DS2502/5/6)</font></b></li>

<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Dallas Semiconductor makes a device that
can be programmed in the factory (by Dallas) for an additional charge of
about $.25 per part.&nbsp; There are a few different versions of the part
that have varying amounts of programmable space available.&nbsp;&nbsp;
According to Dallas technical support, a small quantity of parts can be
ordered to verify that the data is what you want, then a larger quantity
of parts can be ordered (note that large quantity does not necessarily
mean tens of thousands, although it could).&nbsp; The part would then contain
a unique 48-bit ID number followed by the data that you tell Dallas to
put in the parts programmable memory. It will be read-only; so, unless
the device is physically removed from the circuit board,&nbsp; it&nbsp;
provides each board with a programmed MAC address and a guaranteed unique
ID number that can be used as its tracking number for maintenance records.&nbsp;
Refer to <a href="http://www.dalsemi.com/DocControl/PDFs/appindex.html">Application

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">PROs:</font>

<li>

<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Serial EEPROM</font></b></li>

<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Several vendors have various kinds of
serial EEPROM ranging in storage size from bytes to Kbytes.&nbsp; A device
like this could be used and programmed by the factory to contain MAC address
and other project-specific information.&nbsp; Access to the device is not
directly through a memory address, so it is unlikely that the device would
ever be "accidentally" modified as a result of some code bug.&nbsp; There
are probably arrangements (similar to those provided by Dallas) that can
be made with the manufacturers of these parts as well.</font>
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">MAC (and optionally IP) in read-only section

<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The monitor is set up to be provisioned
with the MAC and IP address stored in locations of the boot flash that
are conveniently accessible by factory personell that are programming the
devices.&nbsp; This means that each flash could be loaded with a unique
MAC and/or IP address and the monitor will deal with that.&nbsp; The sectors
used by the monitor could be made read-only when programmed, so this would
provide a mechanism that does not require any additional hardware, but
each flash device would have to be uniquely programmed and the monitor
would not be remotely updateable.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">PROs:</font>
<ul>
<li>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">No additional parts involved.</font></li>

</ul>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">CONs:</font>
<ul>
<li>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">If the monitor is made read-only so that the
MAC cannot be overwritten, then the monitor also cannot be modified.&nbsp;
An exception to this is that the flash boot sector could contain enough
code to jump out of the read-only sector to the remainder of the monitor
that would not be read-only.</font></li>

<li>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">Each FLASH device would have to be uniquely
programmed.</font></li>
</ul>

<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">First sector(s) of TFS made read-only</font></b></li>

<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The initial sector of flash allocated
to TFS could be made read-only after programming of certain configuration
files has been done.&nbsp; This supports a variety of site-dependent data
that can be stored away as a file in TFS and accessible by the application
(read-only).</font></ul>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
If some mechanism of making the flash read-only is used, then optionally,
some flash devices provide a mechanism that allows a sector to be temporarily
un-protected.&nbsp; This means that a jumper could be installed into the
hardware to allow the read-only sectors to be writeable if necessary.&nbsp;
In the case of the serial EEPROM, a layer of software protection can be
added if access to the EEPROM is only made through the command line of
the monitor... One command can be used to open a protection window, and
a second command can be used to actually make the EEPROM modifications
only if the protection window is opened.&nbsp; This eliminates any one
leg of code from being accidentally called to modify EEPROM content.</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The point of this whole discussion is that the monc file can provide a
convenient means of storage for the MAC address during development, but
it is not a practical means for product deployment (unless it is made read-only),
so plan ahead!</font></blockquote>

Example:</font></h2>

<blockquote><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
This section discusses another example of a bootup scenerio that doesn't
use BOOTP or DHCP but still has the ability to intelligently re-download
its application and even a new monitor if necessary.&nbsp; The first script,
called <i>Go</i>, is an autobootable script that simply retreives a second
script (called S<i>ysStart</i>) and executes it.&nbsp; The second script
is where the smarts are.&nbsp; Note that this example assumes that the
final application (called SysApp) is simply an executable script (flags
= 'e').&nbsp; For a real application, the flags are likely to be different.</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The idea here is that all targets are loaded with the "Go" script, then
as the application and/or monitor changes, the content of the "SysStart"
script is modified on the TFTP server to cause a new download of the appropriate
file (monitor and/or application).&nbsp; Note that this does cause a TFTP
file transfer to be done on every reset; but, it does not cause any excessive
wear on the flash because TFS is smart enough to NOT touch the flash if
the file being added is identical to what is already there.</font>
