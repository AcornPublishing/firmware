<blockquote><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ideally, the
functions that are most heavily used by the application should be the ones
that are most heavily optimized.&nbsp; The purpose behind "profiling" an
application is to determine what functions (or tasks) are active the most.&nbsp;
This provides the developer with pointers to the code that should be worked
on hardest.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This page discusses how MicroMonitor
can help a developer profile an application.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The "<a href="../commands/prof.html">prof</a>"
command is used to configure the runtime portion of the profiler and to
dump the statistics gathered by the profiler.&nbsp; The runtime portion
of this is handled through a call to <a href="../api/profiler.html">mon_profiler()</a>.&nbsp;
This monitor API function is called with a pointer to a monprof structure...</font>
<br>&nbsp;
<blockquote><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; struct monprof {</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; int type;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; int pc;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; int tid;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }</tt></blockquote>

<p><br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Refer to <a href="../src/common/monitor/monprof.h.html">monprof.h</a>
for the latest information.&nbsp; Currently there are three different modes
of operation (bitfields in the 'type' member) supported by this profiler:
MONPROF_FUNCLOG, MONPROF_TIDLOG and MONPROF_PCLOG.&nbsp; Each of them have
their value and depend on the CPU and facilities available in the target
hardware.&nbsp; The application simply includes monprof.h as a header in
the file that contains some high-priority interrupt (preferably the system
tick) that can call mon_profiler().&nbsp; It must load the 'pc' entry of
the monprof structure with the address that was interrupted by this interrupt
handler, and the 'tid' entry with the task id of the running task.</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Note that MONPROF_FUNCLOG
and MONPROF_PCLOG need the 'pc' entry and MONPROF_TIDLOG needs the 'tid'
entry; hence, both the pc and tid entries may not be required information.</font>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The prof command is used to initialize
the profiler so that it knows how many different TID values to keep track
of.&nbsp; Each time mon_profiler is called the TID value is compared to
all tid values already logged (binary search), if a match is found, then
that TID count is incremented; if no match is found then the new TID value
is inserted into the list.&nbsp; The list is kept sorted so that the TID
search is kept efficient.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Following is an example code snippet that
would be part of the application's system tick handler or some other high-level
interrupt...</font>
<blockquote><tt>struct monprof mp;</tt>
<p><tt>mp.type = MONPROF_TIDLOG;</tt>

Statistics</font></h2>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica"><b>Definition: </b>the ability to determine

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The prof command is used to initialize
the profiler based on the content of the "symtbl" file.&nbsp; This file
is assumed to have its entries in ascending address order, so the profiler
uses the addresses as symbolic ranges into which each interrupted PC will
fall into.&nbsp; For example, if the content of symtbl was:</font>
<br>&nbsp;
<blockquote><tt>main&nbsp; 0x123000</tt>
<br><tt>func&nbsp; 0x123804</tt>
<br><tt>func1 0x124008</tt></blockquote>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">then any interrupted PC value between 0x123000
and 0x123803 would be considered a hit to the function main().&nbsp; This
profiling method uses the content of symtbl, so it is wise to remove all
but the function addresses from symtbl for this profiling method.&nbsp;
Optimizing symtbl provides two benefits: less ram is needed to store this
data and less time is taken in the interrupt handler to determine which
symbolic range the PC has fallen within.&nbsp; At runtime, each call to
mon_profiler() results in a binary search through the list of function
symbol addresses looking for a match between the incoming PC and one of
the symbol address ranges.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Following is an example code snippet that

Statistics</font></h2>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica"><b>Definition:

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The prof command is used to initialize
the profiler based on the size of the application's instruction space (size
of .text section).&nbsp; The runtime profiler assumes that all instructions
are of fixed size and that an array of space equal to the size of the instruction
space is dedicated to this profiling.&nbsp; At the call to mon_profiler()
this mechanism simply takes the interrupted PC and computes an offset into
the secondary text array based on the PC value and the start of the real
.text space.&nbsp; The location of the offset is incremented; hence, this
provides the ability to log each instruction that is interrupted in runtime.&nbsp;
If the memory space is available and the CPU does have a fixed size for
each instruction, then this is a very efficient profiling alternative,
the run-time profiler is simply incrementing a location in a table based
on the incoming PC and some already computed offset between the actual
text space and the "shadow" text space used to log the data.&nbsp; Refer
to the diagram...</font>
