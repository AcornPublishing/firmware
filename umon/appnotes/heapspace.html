<blockquote><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The monitor
has its own memory manager (<a href="../src/common/monitor/malloc.c.html">malloc.c</a>
&amp; <a href="../src/common/monitor/sbrk.c.html">sbrk.c)</a>.&nbsp; By
default, the monitor is typically configured to have 8K of memory dedicated
to the monitor's malloc.&nbsp; There are cases where this may be insufficient
and the monitor configuration can be modified so that a larger amount of
memory is statically allocated for this purpose.&nbsp; An alternative to
this is to extend the space using the -X option of the <a href="../commands/heap.html">heap</a>
command.&nbsp; This allows the monitor's default amount of memory to remain
relatively small, but does not prohibit the ability to increase the size
it if necessary.</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Usually, a project
will put some operating system on top of the monitor and use that OS's
malloc; however, the monitor code itself still maintains its own small
heap independent of the OS.&nbsp; The monitor's heap is used mostly for
shell variable storage and a few operations in TFS, which generally don't
need much memory.&nbsp; Larger allocations can be made if the application
does use the monitor's malloc and also if the ZLIB code is active for decompression.&nbsp;
Following are two examples of situations where <i>heap -X</i> would be
used to compensate for the small amount of memory configured for use by
the monitor's malloc, but still not require that the monitor have a large
heap compiled in.&nbsp; Note that an alternative to the "heap -X" command
at the monitor's command line is to use the API call <a href="../api/heapextend.html">mon_heapextend()</a>.</font></blockquote>

Application that uses the monitor's malloc:</font></font></h1>

<blockquote><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Usually, an
application has its own malloc and when it takes over the target, the monitor's
malloc is only used by the monitor.&nbsp; This doesn't have to be the case.&nbsp;
A small application that does not need an OS may still need some way to
allocate memory temporarily, so <a href="../api/malloc.html">mon_malloc()</a>
can be used for this.&nbsp; This being the case, then it is likely that
the 8K of space compiled in as the monitor's heap will not be sufficient.&nbsp;
This is where <b><i>heap -X {start,size}</i></b> comes in...&nbsp; In the
monrc file (or anywhere prior to the application starting to allocate memory
beyond the basic 8K), set up these two parameters.&nbsp; The value of <i>start</i>
should be loaded with a starting address from which malloc will get additional
memory and size is the size of that block of memory.&nbsp; Once this is
done, the monitor's malloc will be able to allocated memory from that block
of space if it cannot fulfill a request using its initial 8K of space.</font></blockquote>

ZLIB to decompress files in TFS:</font></font></h1>

<blockquote><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The use of
zlib to decompress is likely to need more than the basic 8K of memory that
the monitor's heap is configured with.&nbsp; Like the above example, the
heapsize can be increased to allow zlib to do its thing.&nbsp; This is
good, but once zlib has completed the decompression of the application,
it is very likely that heap extension will no longer be needed by the monitor.&nbsp;
To compensate for this, the extension can be "de-allocated" from the monitor
as long as there is no memory currently allocated in the space that spans
the extension.&nbsp; For example, the heap can be extended, the executable
decompressed into DRAM, then the heap can be "un-extended" and control
can then be turned over to the application.&nbsp; The only obvious requirement
is that the space into which the application is being loaded can not overlap
with the extended heap space.&nbsp; Following is a pictorial view of the
extended heap space and a script to extend the heap, load a compressed
executable, "unextend" the heap and run the executable...</font></blockquote>
