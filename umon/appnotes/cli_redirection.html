<blockquote><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The monitor's command line supports
the ability to log the output of a command to a memory buffer and ultimately
to a file.&nbsp; At build time, the INCLUDE_REDIRECT macro must be set
to 1 in config.h to enable this.&nbsp; The syntax for doing this is similar,
though not identical, to standard redirection on Unix.&nbsp; The difference
is due to the fact that the redirection code within the monitor must be
supplied with not only a file name, but also a buffer and buffer size.&nbsp;
The idea here is that once supplied with a buffer, command output can be
copied to this buffer and eventually the buffer will be transferred to
a file.&nbsp; The syntax follows, with the redirection directives in red...</font>
<br>&nbsp;
<ul>
<li>
<tt><font size=+1>uMON> echo this is some text <font color="#FF0000">>buffer,buffer_size[,filename]</font></font></tt></li>

<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">This is the syntax for the single right
arrow.&nbsp; A one or two comma delimited string containing a buffer address
followed by the size of the buffer and an optional file name.&nbsp; If
the filename is specified, then the output of the command is copied to
the buffer (truncated at buffer_size if necessary) and then transferred
to TFS as "filename".&nbsp; The running buffer pointer is reset back to
the base address of buffer.&nbsp;&nbsp; If filename is omitted, then the
output of the command is copied to the buffer and the pointer into the
buffer is left at the position just after the data copied (assuming buffer_size
is not reached).</font>
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<tt><font size=+1>uMON> echo this is more text <font color="#FF0000">>>[filename]</font></font></tt></li>

<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#000000">This syntax is used
to append the output of the command to the buffer that was created by the
'>' syntax described above.&nbsp; If 'filename' is present, then the content
of the buffer is transferred to TFS as "filename" and the running buffer
pointer is reset back to the base address of the buffer.&nbsp; If "filename"
is not specified, there is no transfer to a file, the running pointer is
incremented to the position just after the data copied (once again assuming
buffer_size is not reached).</font></font></ul>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#000000">In both cases above,
the "filename" string can contain up to 2 additional commas.&nbsp; These
would be used to tell TFS the flags and info field to apply to the file
when it is created, so the filename string could be "filename,flags,info".</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#000000">The memory space
used is independent of the monitor's implementation of this capability;
hence, it is the users responsibility to make sure that the buffer and
size is memory space that can be used.&nbsp; There are a few different
ways to determine a buffer area.&nbsp; Typically, the buffer would simply
be <a href="../shellvars.html#APPRAMBASE">$APPRAMBASE</a>, but if the application
is running or for some reason $APPRAMBASE is not appropriate, then the
<a href="../commands/heap.html">heap</a>
-m command can be used to allocate a buffer from the monitor's own heap
space.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#000000">Here is an example
with a buffer created and two additional command outputs appended to the
buffer prior to it being transferred to a file (once again, the redirection
directives are in red)...</font></font>
<blockquote>
<blockquote><tt><font size=+1><font color="#000000">echo this is some text
</font><font color="#FF0000">>$APPRAMBASE,4000</font></font></tt>
<br><tt><font size=+1><font color="#000000">echo this is another line of
text </font><font color="#FF0000">>></font></font></tt>
<br><tt><font size=+1><font color="#000000">echo this is the final line
</font><font color="#FF0000">>>logfile</font></font></tt></blockquote>
</blockquote>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#000000">Line 1 establishes the
buffer to be 4000 bytes starting at APPRAMBASE.&nbsp; The command output
is copied to the starting point of the buffer.&nbsp; Line 2 appends the
output of the second command to the buffer (no file transfer).&nbsp; Line
3 appends to the buffer and then transfers the buffer to "logfile".</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#000000">Note that at all
times during the buffer writes, if the running pointer reaches the end
of the buffer (as specified by the buffer_size), then the logging is stopped.&nbsp;
When, eventually, the directive is specified to write the file, it will
have truncated to the size of the buffer.</font></font></blockquote>
