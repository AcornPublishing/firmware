<blockquote><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are several
ways an application (as well as the monitor itself) can be installed/upgraded
on a system running MicroMonitor.&nbsp;&nbsp; One basic assumption is that
the target system already has some version of the monitor installed and
running on the target.&nbsp; With that as a given, the monitor's XMODEM
and TFTP facilities provide mechanisms for upgrades through a serial port
or over ethernet.&nbsp; The monitor itself has a TFTP client and server.&nbsp;
As a client, TFTP can be used in conjunction with DHCP or BOOTP to automatically
pull down an application from some server.&nbsp; Also, the TFTP client
can be used with some other startup script based on specific application
needs (refer to <a href="../startup.html">system startup</a> for a few
examples).&nbsp; The TFTP server is always running when the monitor is
in control, so pushing a new application down to the target is also an
option.&nbsp; Finally, even without an ethernet connection, XMODEM can
be used to transfer files to TFS or to install a new monitor.&nbsp; The
bottom line is that without any consideration for field upgrade in your
application, use of the monitor provides several basic alternatives right
from the start.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The set of monitor-provided
options do assume that the system is taken out of service during the download
process.&nbsp; This may not be an option, so the running application may
have to download the new application while in service.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Since the files in TFS are copied from flash to DRAM, and then executed
out of DRAM space, the update of the application stored in the FLASH is
relatively straight-forward.&nbsp; The application must have its own <a href="servers.html">TFTP
or FTP server</a> (or some proprietary interface) to support the ability
to download a new application file from a host, but that's it.&nbsp; The
application can do whatever it wants to TFS.&nbsp; This means that the
application (now in DRAM space) can install a new copy of itself in TFS.&nbsp;
Then at some point in the future, the system can be reset and the new application
will automatically boot.&nbsp; If during the overwrite process something
causes the system to reset, then TFS has facilities built in so that the
old copy of the application file is re-installed and it would simply start
back up.&nbsp; It is important to realize that TFS has this fallback mechanism
in place because although it provides the security of knowing that a file
can be updated safely, it does require that that the old file not be removed
from flash space until the new one is 100% installed in flash; hence, this
overhead space must be considered.</font>

<a href="#top"><img SRC="../images/top.gif" NOSAVE height=20 width=20></a><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>Upgrade
of a multi-file application:</font></font></h1>

<blockquote><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The above scenerio is acceptable if the application consists of one file,
but what about the case where the application is made up of several files?&nbsp;
Say our application consists of files: app, data1, data2, data3.&nbsp;
TFS provides the security needed if a reset occurs in the middle of any
one file transfer; but what if a reset occurs in the middle of a group
of files?&nbsp; Now we have (for example) a new "app" and "data1", but
the older "data2" and "data3" files are still installed.</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This becomes the responsibility
of the application, the file system cannot help out here because it has
no idea what files constitute a full set of application files.&nbsp; The
application must be able to determine if the other files within TFS are
the files that it wants, so an easy way of doing this is to include some
kind of "version_sanity" file that contains the name and CRCs of each of
the files in a given application build.&nbsp; The application code would
then look to this file and make sure that all of the files exist and have
the correct CRC.&nbsp; If something fails, the application must deal with
this by notifying an administrator or kicking off a TFTP; or perhaps just
knowing about it is enough for it to deal with it internally somehow.&nbsp;
This gets a bit application specific.&nbsp; The point is that a multi-file
application can easily be dealt with using TFS.</font></blockquote>

<a href="#top"><img SRC="../images/top.gif" NOSAVE height=20 width=20></a><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>Remote
update of monitor binary:</font></font></h1>

<blockquote><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Update of the
monitor binary itself is a bit different.&nbsp; This is because the monitor
is not a file in TFS (since the monitor contains the code that is TFS);
so a different set of steps must be followed.&nbsp; <i><font color="#CC0000"><b>Note
that in the case of a monitor update, there is a small window of time during
which the target's reset vector is erased; hence, during that time if the
target is reset or power-cycled, it will not reboot</b>.</font>&nbsp; </i>I
mention this warning because it is a possibility although I have never
had it happen in a field situation; also, refer to <a href="bootblock.html">boot-block
safety appnote</a> for an optional mechanism that can be part of the monitor
that will protect against the "can't reboot" case.&nbsp; The update is
a multi-step process that is typically handled with a host-resident tool
(<a href="../tools/doc/newmon.html">newmon</a>)...</font>
<ul>
<li>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">Reset the target and don't restart the application.</font></li>

<li>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">Optional step (see note below)</font></li>

<li>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">Download the new image of the monitor into
RAM.</font></li>

<li>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">Erase the old monitor image.</font></li>

<li>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">Burn the new monitor image into the boot flash.</font></li>

<li>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">Reset the target and allow it to autoboot
the applications that were in TFS prior to the monitor upgrade.</font></li>
</ul>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Depending on what has been
updated in the monitor, this is usually all it takes.&nbsp; If; however,
the new monitor includes a modification to the header structure of TFS,
then additional steps are necessary for bootup.&nbsp; This is because the
monitor-upgrade process does not affect the files stored in TFS flash space;
so if the monitor code expects the files to have one header structure and
the files have a different header structure; the monitor will claim that
TFS space is corrupt and no files will be visable.&nbsp; At this point,
the file system would have to be re-initialized (tfs init) and all files
re-installed.&nbsp; TFS header updates are rare.</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Note:</b> If the
monitor does include a TFS header update, then the binary image that newmon
transfers to the target could be configured to include the monitor and
all the files currently resident on the target.&nbsp; This would require
that all files be transferred up to the host and the <a href="../tools/doc/f2mem.html">f2mem</a>
utility be used to build an image that includes these files and the new
monitor image.</font></blockquote>
