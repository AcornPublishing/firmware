<blockquote><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The monitor
and TFS provide a very flexible mechanism to allow an application to be
written in a "file-driven" mode.&nbsp; In other words, a lot of an application's
configuration can be based on the content of files that exist in TFS as
normal, ascii, editable files.&nbsp; An ascii file with simple name/value
pairs can be used by the application for retrieval of all kinds of configuration
parameters.&nbsp; The ascii file can easliy be edited on the target and
the personality of the application is changed.&nbsp; With this flexibility
comes the fact that users can now modify these files fairly easily and
potentially corrupt the data in the file that is read by the application.&nbsp;
Some of this can be avoided by establishing different user levels for different
files such that, only administrators with passwords are able to access
the files.&nbsp; There is still the problem that the administrator may
mistakenly modify a file incorrectly and cause the application to crash
because of a syntax error in the configuration file.</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The data-driven editor
solves this problem. The idea is that you have ascii files that are used
by an application to configure itself.&nbsp; For example, an application
may look to a file to retrieve its IP address, a port number to run some
server on, etc...&nbsp; Without this information, the application would
be unable to do its job.&nbsp; The file contains data that is configured
as name/value pairs; where the name is read by the application code as
an identifier of the string following the name.&nbsp; Extending the example
then, the file may have an entry like this...</font>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote><tt>IPADD: 135.3.94.10</tt></blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since the monitor has an
editor, it is feasible that administration of this parameter be handled
by allowing the user to edit the file to change the IP address.&nbsp; Unfortunately,
this allows the user to change the value to <i>135.3.abc.def</i> and no
error would be detected until the application tried to use this parameter.&nbsp;
Another forseeable error would be that the name was accidentally changed...
IPDD: 135.3.94.10.&nbsp; This too would confuse the application code.</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The data-driven editor
solves this by requiring some additional information be added to the <i>name:value</i>
pair declaration.&nbsp; After the last character of the name and prior
to the colon, an optional set of parens can be added to establish attributes
that are applicable to that particular entry in the file.&nbsp; Then instead
of using an editor to modify the file, a program (from hereon referred
to as ddedit) is run that can parse the parameters and only allow modifications
that the parameters define as being legal. The new line would be as follows...</font>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote><tt>IP_ADD(prompt=IP Address of system|ipa): 123.45.67.89</tt></blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The attributes within the
parenthesis are pipe delimited and in this case provide ddedit with a prompt
to feed the user when asking for a new value and information about what
type of entry syntax to accept (in this case ipa, or IP address type).&nbsp;
Following is an example of a more complicated file that could be edited
by ddedit.&nbsp; The comments explain the attributes...</font>
<blockquote><tt>#</tt>
