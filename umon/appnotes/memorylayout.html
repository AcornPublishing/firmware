<blockquote><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The monitor
itself is a program.&nbsp; As a program, it doesn't require much of the
system that it runs on...&nbsp; An RS-232 port, maybe an ethernet port,
some RAM and some flash.&nbsp; That's about it, and if left at this point,
chances are likely that the hardware will support the needs of the monitor.&nbsp;
On the other hand, the application that the monitor will eventually be
turning control over to may have requirements that justify a little bit
of up-front thinking with regard to the memory layout.&nbsp; There are
a few things to consider when configuring a memory design for use with
a system that will run with MicroMonitor.&nbsp; A wide range of flash devices
are now available.&nbsp; For the sake of this discussion, there are a few
major distinctions between the various devices available:&nbsp; the size
of the device and the flexibility it provides with regard to sector protection...</font>
<ul>
<li>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica"><b>The size of the device </b>is pretty obvious.&nbsp;
You must be sure the application you plan to run, plus the monitor, will
fit in the device.</font></li>

<li>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica"><b>The sector protection flexibility</b> is
a bit less obvious but must be considered if there is any need for some
portion of the device to be unprogrammable while other portions are programmable.&nbsp;
There are a lot of options here.&nbsp; Some devices can be programmed with
an external device programmer and then certain sectors can be made uneraseable.&nbsp;
Once put into the system those uneraseable sectors are safe from any "devious"
firmware that may accidentally attempt to corrupt that space.&nbsp; This
is good.&nbsp; On the other hand, if those sectors ever need to be reprogrammed,
then the device will have to be removed from the target system and reprogrammed
by the external device programmer.&nbsp; Some of the newer parts support
"temporary sector un-protect" and there are varying levels of support for
this.&nbsp; Some of the parts go into an "unprotect" mode if some higher
voltage is applied to a pin, while others simply need to have one of their
pins set to a high or low state (via some physical jumper).&nbsp; Lots
of choices here, so think about what you need before you just assume "flash
is flash".</font></li>
</ul>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">Following is a list of considerations that
start with a system that needs minimal memory support, up through a system
that should consider additional hardware support for TFS.&nbsp; Each question
is followed by a brief discussion and a device suggestion in italics.</font>
<br>&nbsp;
<h2>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+0>Will the system ever be updated
after initial factory installation?</font></font></h2>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If the answer to this question
is no, then you have the simplest of systems.&nbsp; The monitor and application
files can be burned into the memory and as long as the code doesn't try
to modify anything, everything will work fine.
<i>Since this system does
not require any in-system changes, it would be adequate to use EPROM, but
EPROM is quickly becoming "old" technology.&nbsp; Careful consideration
should be taken if EPROM is being considered.&nbsp; Much of the flexibility
of the monitor is lost without the ability to write to the file system.</i></font>
<h2>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+0>Is it ok for the monitor binary
to be in flash space that is eraseable?</font></font></h2>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If the answer to this question
is yes, then the monitor and application files can all exist in the same
flash device and there is no need to consider any hardware-assisted flash
protection, just leave all the flash in its normal write/erase more.&nbsp;
If the answer to this is no, then either the sectors of the flash device
that contain the monitor must be protected, or the boot monitor must be
in a different device than TFS.&nbsp; <i>This system would be adequately
served by an AMD 29F010-type device.&nbsp; It's simple, and is probably
at the lower end of the price range for flash.</i></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Note that if the monitor binary is in
space that is not eraseable, then it cannot be updated in the field.</font>
<h2>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+0>Is there a need for some files
in TFS to be un-eraseable and others to be eraseable?</font></font></h2>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If the answer to this is
yes, then the hardware must be able to selectively protect (or not)&nbsp;
multiple sectors of flash space.&nbsp; Note that this does not necessarily
mean any additional hardware, it can be addressed by selecting a more versatile
flash device.&nbsp; <i>The Intel TE28F320 device (family) is very versatile
for this kind of stuff.</i></font>
<h2>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+0>Is there a need for some files
to be very frequently written and rewritten?</font></font></h2>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If the answer to this is
yes, then the best solution is to add some battery backed ram to the system
and overlay TFS onto that memory range.&nbsp; Note that we are talking
about tens-of-thousands of rewrites here, not just a few. <i>Dallas Semiconductor
makes BBRAM parts that have the battery built into the device and tout
a 10-year life.&nbsp; They also have devices that allow you to turn a normal
SRAM into a battery-backed RAM.</i></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once the answers to
these questions are known, then it's necessary to decide what hardware
support to add and if not added, what adjustments need to be made to the
requirements.&nbsp; For the bottom boot system, the monitor would reside
just above the reset vector address of the CPU.&nbsp; For the top boot
system, the monitor would reside just below the reset vector address of
the CPU.&nbsp; Following are a few diagrams that should help...</font></blockquote>
