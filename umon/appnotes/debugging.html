<center><font face="Arial,Helvetica">This page will discuss how MicroMonitor
can help a developer debug an application.&nbsp; Portions of these capabilities
are CPU and compiler independent, but some portions do require code in
the monitor that is specific to the target hardware and the compiler used.&nbsp;
That being the case, sections of the following discussion that are not
CPU and compiler independent may not be available on all target systems.</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">For additional debugging tips, refer to
<a href="../commands/strace.html">stack trace</a> and <a href="../commands/prof.html">profiling</a>

<h2>
<a href="#top"><img SRC="../images/top.gif" NOSAVE height=20 width=20></a><a NAME="symbolic_debugging"></a><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Symbolic
Debugging:</font></h2>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica"><b>Definition:</b> the ability to look at
variables of various types (integer, short, struct, etc...)&nbsp; in the
target system without the need to be aware of their actual physical address.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The monitor's ability to do symbolic debugging
comes from the command line interface's (CLI) ability to replace "symbols"
on the command line with "replacement strings" from the symbol table.&nbsp;
The symbol table for the monitor is a simple file (called <i>symtbl</i>)
in TFS.&nbsp; Each line in the file is assumed to contain a symbol name
followed by a string to replace the symbol name.&nbsp; In all cases of
its usage so far, the string that replaces the symbol name is a hex address,
but this is not a requirement.</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Following is an example that uses <i>symtbl</i>
to replace a string with a hex address.&nbsp; Assume we have the following
lines in our <i>symtbl</i> file in TFS...</font>
<br>&nbsp;
<blockquote>
<blockquote><tt>IpAddr_binary&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0xf0041008</tt>
<br><tt>MacAddr_binary&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0xf0042000</tt>
<br><tt>myVariable&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0xf0042040</tt>
<br><tt>ipHdr&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
0xf0048010</tt>
<br><tt>testFunction&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0xf0100480</tt></blockquote>
</blockquote>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">With that, we can now type in the following
command on the monitor console...</font>
<blockquote>
<blockquote><tt>dm -4d %myVariable 1</tt></blockquote>
</blockquote>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">and it will be converted by the monitor's
CLI to...</font>
<blockquote>
<blockquote><tt>dm -4d 0xf0042040 1</tt></blockquote>
</blockquote>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">The command interpreter then processes the
converted line.&nbsp; The result is that whatever was stored in&nbsp; <i>myVariable</i>
as a 4-byte integer will be displayed in decimal format to the user (see
<a href="../commands/dm.html">dm</a>
command for details on output formats); with the user&nbsp; unaware of
the physical location of the&nbsp; variable.&nbsp;&nbsp; All commands within
the monitor can&nbsp; take advantage of this symbolic replacement by the
CLI, but certain commands are more applicable to symbolic debugging.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">To modify a location in memory, use the
"<a href="../commands/pm.html">pm</a>" command (similar in syntax to dm).&nbsp;
The following line...</font>
<blockquote>
<blockquote><tt>pm -4 %myVariable 87</tt></blockquote>
</blockquote>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">will place decimal 87 into the location 0xf0042040,
assuming it is a 4-byte integer.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">To execute a function within the system,
the "<a href="../commands/call.html">call</a>" command can be used.&nbsp;
The following line...</font>
<blockquote>
<blockquote><tt>call %testFunction</tt></blockquote>
</blockquote>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">will execute the function "testFunction()"
assumed to reside in memory at 0xf0100480.&nbsp; The return value will
be displayed and arguments could be passed to it.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Finally, and probably most useful is the
"cast" command.&nbsp; The following line...</font>
<blockquote>
<blockquote><font face="Arial,Helvetica">cast ip %ipHdr</font></blockquote>
</blockquote>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">will display memory starting at location 0xf0048010
as a structure of type "ip" (see <a href="../commands/cast.html">cast</a>
for more details).</font>

<a href="#top"><img SRC="../images/top.gif" NOSAVE height=20 width=20></a><a NAME="Runtime_trace"></a><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Run-time
Trace:</font></h2>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica"><b>Definition: </b>the ability to analyze
the behaviour of a system as it is carrying out the tasks it was designed
to carry out, without severely affecting the performance and without modifying
the code.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Note, first that this is "run-time" not
"real-time" trace; although, it is about as close to real time as you are
going to get without the help of external equipment.&nbsp; One of the commands
in the monitor is called "<a href="../commands/at.html">at</a>".&nbsp;
This is an attempt to provide the ability to do some fairly sophisticated
run-time state analysis by setting a variety of breakpoints, or hooks,
in the code that allow the user to keep track of events.&nbsp; For example,
as a simple case, you could set up a counter that would keep track of the
number of times a particular function is called.&nbsp; Or you could cause
a breakpoint to occur ONLY after some other function has occurred 3 times.&nbsp;
There is a difference between a breakpoint and a hook.&nbsp;&nbsp; A breakpoint
causes the application to stop and turn over control to the monitor; while
a hook simply causes the application to branch into some record-keeping
code in the monitor and then continue from the point of the branch.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#FF0000"><b>Note1: </b>An
important limitation of the monitor regarding breakpoints is that once
a breakpoint (not a hook) has been taken, there is no turning back.&nbsp;
The monitor does not support the ability to resume execution of the application.&nbsp;
This limitation keeps the monitor simple, because a <i>true</i> breakpoint
would have to shutdown all periphery until control was returned to the
application.&nbsp; This can be quite tricky and is heavily target-system
dependent, so keeping simplicity in mind, it is not a feature of this monitor's
debug capability.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#FF0000"><b>Note2: </b>This
capability, although implemented for some earlier monitor ports, has not
been used much lately; hence, it needs work to be compatible with some
of the current CPUs.</font></font>
<h2>
<a href="#top"><img SRC="../images/top.gif" NOSAVE height=20 width=20></a><a NAME="Stack_trace"></a><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Context-Sensitive
Stack Trace:</font></h2>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica"><b>Definition:
</b>the ability to determine
how the system reached a certain point in the code (function nesting) for
both single and multi-threaded applications.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">What do you do if you hit a piece of code
(or take an exception) and want to know how you got there?&nbsp; A stack
trace capability is invaluable in cases like this.&nbsp; MicroMonitor has
a stack trace capability that allows the user to step back through the
function nesting to see each of the functions that have been called to
reach the current context.&nbsp; Having this capability allows the user
to insert a "man-made" exception into an error leg of the code and upon
taking that exception the user can quickly determine how the code got there.&nbsp;
Refer to the <a href="../commands/strace.html">strace</a> command for more
details.&nbsp; Following is an example of a system exception followed by
the monitor's strace output...</font>
