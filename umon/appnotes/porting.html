<blockquote><font face="Arial,Helvetica">One of the design goals of this
monitor package was to make it simple to port to new processors and target
hardware.&nbsp; There are a few things in the monitor (timing in particular)
which suffer a bit just to keep the porting effort to a minimum. The two
most significant points are...</font>
<ul>
<li>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The monitor does not use any interrupts
from the CPU</font></b></li>

<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">From the porting point of view this is
a real luxury.&nbsp; It makes it much easier to get a port to a new processor
up and running.&nbsp; You don't have to worry about how a processor's interrupt
handler mechanism is set up and you don't have to worry about making sure
you save all the registers appropriately.&nbsp; Additionally, the serial
port and ethernet drivers are much less complex because everything is polled.&nbsp;
Not having interrupts means that it is a bit more difficult (and somewhat
inaccurate) to deal with elapsed time.&nbsp; If you have no clock reference,
then you don't really know how much time has passed; however, to get around
this a bit, there is a calibration that is made by the "sleep" command
that allows you to tweek this timing a bit.&nbsp; Still, it is admittedly
inaccurate, but worth it.&nbsp; Keep in mind that the drivers in the monitor
are not intended to be reused by the application anyway.&nbsp; If the overlaying
application needs a real driver, then that application needs to provide
it.</font>
<li>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The monitor code assumes that initialized
data is not writeable</font></b></li>

<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The monitor code is running (fetching
instructions) directly out of flash (see note1 below).&nbsp; The monitor
does not copy any .data space to ram, so it too is accessed in runtime
from flash.&nbsp; This means that the monitor's initialized data is not
writeable.&nbsp; Yep, this is something to be aware of; but, once again,
it makes the port much easier because now there is no need to figure out
how the compiler toolset allows the data section to be remapped to ram
space and there is no need to copy the data section into ram space (see
note2 below).&nbsp; On the other hand, the monitor DOES assume that on
startup the .bss section is initialized to zero (see <a href="../src/common/monitor/start.c.html#start">start.c</a>).&nbsp;
This is ok because it is easy to clear a block of memory regardless of
the toolset.</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><b>Note1:</b> the functions that perform
write/erase operations on the flash are executed out of RAM.&nbsp; This
is necessary because most flash devices do not allow the device to be modified
if instructions are being fetched from it at the same time.</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><b>Note2:</b> initialized data in an embedded
system must exist in non-volatile memory, and prior to application startup,
if the data is to be writeable, it must be copied from non-volatile space
to ram.&nbsp; This is done so that at startup the data is properly initialized
and at runtime the application has the option to change it.&nbsp; This
means that some compiler-specific directives must be used to make sure
that the data space in flash is copied from flash to some space in RAM
where the application code will be able to access/modify it.&nbsp; This
complexity is avoided in the monitor by carefully making sure that no initialized
data is modified in the monitor code.</font></ul>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>Porting details...</font></font></b>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><b>First things first:</b>&nbsp; Before
beginning your port, make sure you are aware of what the monitor needs
and provides. It assumes a CPU with linear address space (no bank switching,
and if x86, then use a memory model that eliminates the need for C-code
to deal with segmentation).&nbsp; To use TFS, an obvious assumption is
flash.&nbsp; TFS assumes that the flash is accessible directly on the address/data
bus, there is no IDE or I2C (or any other) interface between the memory
allocated to TFS and the CPU.&nbsp; Make sure you are aware of the <a href="../tfs.html#flash_life">flash
life expectancy issues with TFS</a> and based on the features that you
decide to use within the monitor platform, make sure you have the memory
space to allocate for it.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">There are 4 sections of code within the
monitor that need to be modified when porting to a new target.&nbsp; Based
on the ports already available, some of these sections may be re-usable
from other ports that have already been made, so it is wise to check with
the <a href="mailto:esutter@lucent.com">author</a> prior to starting this
work.</font>
<ul>
<li>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">Code to handle CPU reset, basic exception
handling and getting up to 'C' level (see <a href="../src/targets/target_dirname/monitor/reset.s.html">reset.s</a>
and <a href="../src/common/monitor/start.c.html">start.c</a>).</font></li>

<li>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">Code for a polled serial port driver (see
<a href="../src/targets/target_dirname/monitor/cpuio.c.html">cpuio.c</a>).</font></li>

<li>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">Code for a&nbsp; flash device driver (see
<a href="../src/common/flash/flash_dirname/flashdev.c.html">flashdev.c</a>
and <a href="../src/common/flash/flash_dirname/flashpic.c.html">flashpic.c</a>).</font></li>

<li>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">Code for a polled ethernet driver (see <a href="../src/targets/target_dirname/monitor/etherdev.c.html">etherdev.c</a>).</font></li>
</ul>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">There are currently two top-level directories
that contain the code... the <a href="../src/common">common</a> directory
and the <a href="../src/targets">target-specific</a> directory.&nbsp; The&nbsp;
code under the common directory should be left untouched.&nbsp; Those files
have been designed to interface to the target-specific code found under
the targets/<i>targetname</i>/monitor (where <i>targetname</i> is the name
of some target platform) directory and the common/flash/<i>flashname</i>
(where <i>flashname</i> is some flash device name) directory.&nbsp;&nbsp;
The only exception to this rule is if you are writing a new flash driver;
then, a new common/flash/<i>new_flashname</i> directory would be created
and the new drivers would be written similar to one of the existing flash
device drivers.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">When starting a port, retrieve the latest
tar file from the author and copy it to some workspace.&nbsp; Change the
name of the target-specific directory.&nbsp; Change the name to something
that contains an acronym for your target followed by a string representing
the CPU (ie.. abcsh2 is the ABC board with the Hitachi SH2 processor).&nbsp;
Also, under the common directory, if you will be writing a new flash device
driver, change the name of the directory containing the flash code to the
name of the device you are going to be using.&nbsp; For the sake of this
discussion, let's assume the target-specific directory name is ABC960 and
the common/flash directory is 29XX32.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">At this point we are ready to start modifying
code.&nbsp; The first thing to do is to reduce the complexity of the monitor
by turning off the majority of the features established by the ABC960/monitor/config.h
file.&nbsp; In this file there is a block of INCLUDE_<i>FEATURE</i> macros
(where <i>FEATURE</i> is some feature-specific string).&nbsp; Following
is what can be used as the minimal configuration...</font>

<font face="Arial,Helvetica">This configuration provides a very basic monitor...
a serial port driver with xmodem for download and memory commands for interfacing
to target memory.&nbsp; Refer to the file <a href="../src/common/monitor/inc_check.h.html">inc_check.h</a>
for the most up-to-date list of these definitions and their meaning. The
files that need the work now are reset.s and cpuio.c.&nbsp; If this is
the first attempt at this processor, then spend some time looking for some
example code from the CPU manufacturer's website.&nbsp; This is usually
not too hard to find.&nbsp; For the very first build attempt, don't even
worry about the exception handlers.&nbsp; Once this is working, then add
the exception handling stuff found in ABC960/monitor/except.c and ABC960/monitor/vectors.s.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">At this point, you have a basic monitor
working.&nbsp; Next, enable INCLUDE_FLASH and start working on the files
under <a href="../src/common/flash/flash_dirname">common/flash/flash_dirname</a>.&nbsp;
Use the current code as a model. You can use XMODEM to download small programs
and run them by executing the "<a href="../commands/call.html">cal</a>l"
comand.&nbsp; Once the flash driver is operational, the <a href="../commands/xmodem.html">Xmodem
-B</a> command can be used to download new monitor binaries without the
need for an external programmer.&nbsp;&nbsp; After that, enable INCLUDE_TFS
and the file system stuff will be active.&nbsp; Note that there are a few
additional configuration macros in config.h that must be established for
TFS, plus look at <a href="../src/targets/target_dirname/monitor/tfsdev.h.html">tfsdev.h</a>
to configure each of the flash devices within TFS.&nbsp; The final step
is to enable INCLUDE_ETHERNET and work on the code in etherdev.c.&nbsp;&nbsp;
At this point, since you have a working monitor with TFS, you can download
small applications that include your ethernet code to conveniently test
it out.&nbsp; That will give you the ethernet interface.&nbsp; Once this
works, all of the other macros can be enabled as needed and the port is
completed.</font>

</table>

<p>There is also tfsdev.h.&nbsp; This header file is used to help the tfs
code with the possibility of there being more than one memory device over
which TFS will span.&nbsp; For most targets, TFS will only span one contiguous
block of flash; however, TFS does support multiple non-contiguous blocks.&nbsp;
The tfsdev.h structure establishes this.&nbsp; So for most targets, the
structure will look like this...
<pre><tt>struct tfsdev tfsdevtbl[] = {</tt></pre>

<pre><tt>&nbsp;{ "//040/",&nbsp; TFSSTART,&nbsp; TFSEND,&nbsp; TFSSPARE,&nbsp; TFSSPARESIZE,&nbsp; TFSSECTORCOUNT,&nbsp; TFS_DEVTYPE_FLASH, },</tt></pre>

<pre><tt>&nbsp;{ 0, TFSEOT, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 }</tt></pre>

<pre><tt>};</tt></pre>
The first member of the first entry in the table is the name to be associated
with the device.&nbsp; See <a href="../src/common/monitor/tfsprivate.h.html">tfsprivate.h</a>
for details.
<br>TFS can be set up so that the device used is somewhat dynamic (within
a family).&nbsp; If you have a target that may be configured with a 29F040
or a 29F010 for example, then set the TFS_DEVTYPE_DYNAMIC bit and all other
entries NULL.&nbsp; This assumes that you have written your flash driver
to deal with this.&nbsp; See the 29F040 code for an example.
<pre><tt>struct tfsdev tfsdevtbl[] = {</tt></pre>

<pre><tt>&nbsp;{ "//040/",&nbsp; TFSSTART,&nbsp; 0,&nbsp; 0,&nbsp; 0,&nbsp; 0,&nbsp; TFS_DEVTYPE_FLASH | TFS_DEVINFO_DYNAMIC, },</tt></pre>

<pre><tt>&nbsp;{ 0, TFSEOT, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 }</tt></pre>
<tt>};</tt>
<p>If there is a need to configure a second device, then the parameters
for that second entry would be taken from a second set of parameters that
would be established for the second device in config.h (like TFSSTART_1,
TFSEND_1, TFSSPARE_1, etc...).&nbsp; The structure would then simply have
a third entry...
<br>&nbsp;
<pre><tt>struct tfsdev tfsdevtbl[] = {</tt></pre>

<pre><tt>&nbsp;{ "//040/",&nbsp;&nbsp; TFSSTART,&nbsp;&nbsp; TFSEND,&nbsp;&nbsp; TFSSPARE,&nbsp;&nbsp; TFSSPARESIZE,&nbsp;&nbsp; TFSSECTORCOUNT,&nbsp;&nbsp; TFS_DEVTYPE_FLASH, },</tt></pre>

<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">A few suggestions...</font></b>
<ul>
<li>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">It is important to take little steps when
doing a port.&nbsp; The config.h INCLUDE_XXX macros allow you to do this.&nbsp;
Don't try to build the whole platform in one shot.&nbsp; One step at a
time will get you there a lot faster!!!</font></li>

<li>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">Don't even enable cache if your CPU has it.&nbsp;
Just leave it off until you have the port complete and you build up some
confidence in what you have.</font></li>

<li>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">Make sure optimization is turned off.&nbsp;
Eventually, you can enable it and things should be made to work with optimization;
however, eliminate that complexity when starting a new port.</font></li>

<li>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">In all of the driver polling loops insert
some type of timeout.&nbsp; If the timeout occurs, depending on where it
occurs, you can do a few different things: if the timeout occurs in a UART-related
poll, then blink an LED, or do SOMETHING to let the outside world know
where the code is.&nbsp; If the timeout occurs somewhere after the uart
interface is known to be up and running, then call some simple error message
that will print out the serial port.</font></li>

<li>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">In the start() function, make sure that ramstart
&amp; ramend variables are properly pointing to the beginning and end of
the monitor-owned .bss space.&nbsp; Also, when first bringing up a new
port, force this bss initialization to be done by defining the FORCE_BSS_INIT
macro in config.h.</font></li>
