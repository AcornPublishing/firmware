<blockquote><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The monitor
makes no assumption about the underlying FLASH memory other than the fact
that it is broken up into some fixed number of sectors and that there is
an algorithm that allows the monitor to write and/or erase data within
those sectors.&nbsp; This means that the monitor can be put in a system
and there is no immediate need to be concerned with what capabilities the
system has to protect its own memory space.&nbsp; It is up to the user
to make sure that the monitor is able to work with the capabilities of
the system to best protect the flash from undesired corruption.&nbsp; At
the one extreme, all flash can be left unprotected and chances are very
good that there will never be a problem simply because it's not easy to
accidentally reproduce the flash algorithms necessary to cause a write
or erasure.&nbsp; At the other extreme, all flash can be write protected
and there is no need to ever worry about a corruption problem even if the
"evil" code is executed.&nbsp; Obviously there are quite a few different
other options between these two and the approach taken is really based
on the application.&nbsp; <b>The purpose of this section is to discuss
one option that provides the system with the ability to update almost any
portion of the flash (monitor or TFS space) without fear of ever losing
a system because of some error in the process of the update.&nbsp;</b>
For the sake of this discussion the term "losing a system" refers to the
situation where the flash update somehow went astray causing the system
to no longer boot; this means that the device must come back to the factory
for reprogramming.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The normal monitor does
a good job of detecting a corrupt file in TFS, but does not have the ability
to detect corruption within itself; so, if the flash space that is occupied
by the monitor is not hardware protected (which it wouldn't be if there
were ever a need to update the monitor), then there is the potential of
it becoming corrupted and leaving the system in an unrecoverable state.&nbsp;
The obvious solution to this would be to hardware protect all of the sectors
that are used by the monitor binary; then it would be impossible for the
system to trash the flash used by the monitor; unfortunately, this means
that the monitor itself could not be updated (this may be an acceptable
case, and if so, you're done here!).</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If there is a need to
occasionally update the monitor in the field, then use of a boot-sector
safety is recommended.&nbsp; The system startup is modified slightly such
that the monitor does not have initial control of the CPU.&nbsp; The bootsector
code runs a crc on the block of space that contains the monitor binary
and if it passes, it jumps into the monitor; otherwise, it waits for a
new download via XMODEM.&nbsp; In this case, ONLY the sectors used by the
boot-sector safety code (typically less than 4K of space) would be hardware
protected; hence, all portions of the flash, both monitor and TFS, can
be updated and even in the worst case, the system can be rebuilt.&nbsp;

<blockquote><font face="Arial,Helvetica">If the CRC test fails, XMODEM
is run by the boot sector code.&nbsp; The boot sector code does not have
the ability to write to flash by itself.&nbsp; It will download a binary
image to RAM and turn over control to it.&nbsp; That image is expected
to contain enough smarts to then allow a complete reburn of the monitor
into flash.&nbsp; Typically it would be a version of the monitor built
to run in RAM.&nbsp; It can then be used to download a new monitor image
and transfer it to flash.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The creation of this .bsi data is done
with a tool after the final monitor image has been built.&nbsp; It is a
post processing stage that is simply put in the makefile after the final
linkage.&nbsp; The reset code in the monitor must have this space allocated
and the tool, ibsi, is used to insert the data.&nbsp; Refer to
